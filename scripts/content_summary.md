## Overview
This comprehensive guide covers nine different methods for web scraping using n8n, from basic HTTP requests to advanced cloud-based solutions. The tutorial demonstrates both static and dynamic website scraping, with practical examples and API integrations.

## Key Methods
1. Direct HTTP Requests
   - Using n8n's HTTP request node for static websites
   - Works best with non-JavaScript resources
   - Basic GET request functionality

2. Web Scraper Chrome Extension
   - Cloud service integration
   - Handles JavaScript-heavy sites
   - Exports data in various formats

3. Cloud-Based Solutions
   - Support for dynamic content
   - Handles social media platforms
   - Includes field extraction (URLs, metadata, etc.)

## Technical Concepts
1. Static vs Dynamic Sites
   - Static: Direct request returns complete content
   - Dynamic: Server generates content on request
   - Different approaches needed for each type

2. Data Extraction Features
   - Field-specific extraction (captions, URLs, timestamps)
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Export options for structured data

## Implementation Notes
- HTTP requests as first approach for simplicity
- Cloud services for complex/dynamic sites
- Built-in support for various data formats
- Integration with external APIs for enhanced functionality
