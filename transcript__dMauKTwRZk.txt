[0:00] Glide just changed the rules of the game
[0:02] by allowing developers to create
[0:03] automated workflows directly within
[0:05] their platform eliminating the need to
[0:08] rely on thirdparty services like make or
[0:10] zapier and this is a big deal for small
[0:12] businesses because it streamlines
[0:14] processes reduce cost and keeps
[0:16] everything with inside the same
[0:18] ecosystem the workflows interface is
[0:20] friendly and intuitive but it packs a
[0:22] mighty punch by providing powerful
[0:24] features like Loops conditional
[0:26] branching and computed steps all without
[0:28] writing a single line code for example
[0:31] imagine you manage a team and you want
[0:32] to send daily reminders to members about
[0:34] their pending tasks with glide's new
[0:36] workflow feature you can set up a
[0:38] scheduled trigger that automatically
[0:40] sends an email to each team member every
[0:42] morning listing their tasks for the day
[0:45] and you can go one step further by
[0:46] allowing replies to those emails to
[0:48] trigger additional workflows via email
[0:51] triggers so Glide now has the trifecta
[0:53] of building beautiful interfaces on top
[0:56] of scalable data and Powerful
[0:58] automations that will allow you to
[0:59] create create cohesive applications and
[1:01] if you're like me and love all things no
