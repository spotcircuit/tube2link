[0:01] -Our next guest is CNN's
chief White House correspondent.
[0:02] She anchors "The Source"
weeknights at 9:00 on CNN.
[0:05] Please welcome back to the show
[0:07] our friend Kaitlan Collins,
everybody.
[0:08] [ Cheers and applause ]
[0:10] ♪♪
[0:20] -Hi!
-Hello, Kaitlan! How are you?
[0:24] -So, I want you
to ask me every question
[0:25] that you asked Pete Davidson.
[0:27] -You -- just with
the same questions?
[0:29] So, you got an aquarium.
[0:30] -I don't have --
If I had an aquarium,
[0:32] everything would die
within like two days
[0:34] because I would just
never be home.
[0:36] -Yeah. That's really...
[0:37] I mean,
we didn't talk enough about
[0:38] how Pete's keeping those fish
alive, although basically --
[0:40] -Okay, but, no, no.
Okay, why did no one...
[0:42] There were no fish
in that aquarium.
[0:43] -Yeah. Like, did anyone else
[0:45] notice that or was that just me?
-You're really...
[0:47] This is why you're
the good CNN reporter.
[0:50] Literally,
I'm holding it up being like,
[0:51] "Look at you!
Doing good, Pete!"
[0:53] And there's not --
You're right.
[0:54] There was not a single fish
in that photo.
[0:56] -Nothing.
[0:58] -I can't believe
he's paying a guy
[0:59] just to clean an empty tank.
[1:01] -I respect it.
-This is a disaster.
[1:03] I do, I respect it, too.
You know what?
[1:04] Just 'cause there's no fish
[1:05] doesn't mean you want
murky water.
[1:06] -Yeah, exactly.
[1:08] Yeah. To each their own.
-To each their own.
[1:11] So, you're doing this every day.
[ Chuckles ]
[1:13] You're in D.C.
-Yes.
[1:14] -The pace
of the Trump administration
[1:16] seems to be moving
pretty quickly.
[1:17] How are you holding up?
-Um, it is insane.
[1:20] And I think everyone is
kind of like readjusting
[1:23] and re-remembering
what it was like
[1:25] four years ago,
pre four years ago.
[1:27] I remember when Biden
first took office in January,
[1:31] the New York Times wrote
this story about
[1:33] how quiet the weekends were
because, for reporters,
[1:35] every weekend had just been
like another...
[1:37] It was like
a seven-day work week.
[1:39] And now we're back to that,
[1:41] basically where it's just
essentially nonstop every day.
[1:43] You kind of wake up, like,
[1:45] not knowing what
you're going to be doing,
[1:46] what the schedule is.
[1:47] I was walking to get
breakfast one day this week.
[1:49] I was like, okay, I'm gonna
have a nice little breakfast
[1:51] before I go to work.
[1:52] And halfway there,
they were like,
[1:54] "Trump's doing
a press conference in an hour."
[1:56] And I physically ran back home
so I could change and get ready.
[1:59] -I feel like that's
how we all live now,
[2:01] is we would not be
surprised to see someone
[2:03] we know from CNN running.
[2:04] [ Laughter ]
[2:06] You know what I mean?
-Yeah, I don't run.
[2:07] So if you see me running,
[2:08] like, fire up your Twitter
[2:10] 'cause something's about
to happen
[2:12] and it's probably not great.
[2:13] -Yeah. You...
[2:15] So it does seem like also their
philosophy is to flood the zone.
[2:18] And so sometimes,
I imagine for you,
[2:20] like, something happens
on Saturday
[2:22] and you think, oh, well,
this will be our Monday story.
[2:24] -No. Yeah.
-And then, you know,
[2:25] that goes away by the time,
[2:27] you know,
Sunday morning rolls around.
[2:29] Do you think that they
can continue to flood the zone,
[2:31] or is this just the benefit
of being in the early days
[2:34] of the administration?
[2:35] -I think they
definitely want to keep it up
[2:37] for as long as possible,
[2:38] because every day,
you know, they're touting,
[2:40] "Oh, we've signed this many
executive orders
[2:41] or we've done this today,
or this many executive actions,"
[2:45] but it is changing in terms of,
you know,
[2:47] there's a limit of
how much you can do on your own
[2:50] at your desk with your pen
as president.
[2:52] And the other day,
this was evidenced to me
[2:54] because Trump was signing
all these executive orders.
[2:57] And then he signed
this huge sheet of paper.
[2:59] And I texted a source
and I was like, "Wait,
what is he signing?
[3:02] Why is the executive order
like 40 feet wide?"
[3:05] And it was a proclamation.
[3:07] It's basically a formalization
of Mark Burnett,
[3:10] from "The Apprentice,"
who was going to the UK,
[3:13] but it wasn't actually
something that, you know,
[3:15] typically has to be
signed in front of the cameras
[3:17] in the Oval Office.
[3:18] But it was just, you know...
-Right.
[3:19] He likes to sign stuff.
-Signing stuff.
[3:21] -He likes to sign stuff
on camera.
[3:23] And you know what?
[3:24] I think we should
all support it.
[3:26] -Yeah, you should start that.
[3:27] You should start doing that.
[3:28] Sign your own executive orders.
[3:29] -I should just start
every show by signing something
[3:31] but not telling people
what it is.
[3:32] I'm like, this is my secret,
and then I'll put it away.
[3:34] -Aquariums must have fish.
[3:35] -Aquariums must --
[3:36] If you're a guest on this show,
[3:38] bring a picture with fish
in the aquarium.
[3:41] -Done.
-Was the press conference
[3:44] you ran to
[3:45] the joint press conference
with Netanyahu?
[3:47] -That was a separate one
[3:48] that happened on...
Tuesday night?
[3:50] I don't know, I can't even
remember what day it is.
[3:52] -We used a clip of you.
You asked him a question.
[3:53] And it is --
[3:55] There's a different vibe
to a Trump press conference.
[3:57] -Such a different vibe.
[3:59] And I haven't been
[4:00] to a White House
press conference in a while.
[4:01] I was here for two years
[4:02] and I've just returned back to
[4:04] to being the chief
White House correspondent.
[4:06] And typically
when a world leader is there,
[4:08] it's called a "two and two,"
[4:10] and it's two reporters on
the American side get a question
[4:12] and two reporters on whatever
foreign press is visiting --
[4:15] this time the Israeli side.
[4:17] But then after Trump and
Netanyahu gave their statements,
[4:20] I noticed Trump wasn't
looking at a list of reporters
[4:23] to choose from.
[4:25] He was kind of just picking
from the audience.
[4:26] And it was like blood
in the water,
[4:28] like everyone realized
that he could call on anyone.
[4:31] And there were 75 reporters
in that room.
[4:33] -Which is a lot, right?
[4:35] -It was -- the crowds...
[4:36] Like, everyone was squeezed
against the walls.
[4:38] There was nowhere
for anyone to stand.
[4:39] It was like total mayhem.
[4:41] And but you could see
everyone realized this is
[4:43] a freewheeling kind of
press conference.
[4:45] It's not just going to be two
questions and then they're out.
[4:48] And so everyone was standing up
trying to get a question.
[4:50] And it just, you know,
kind of evolved into chaos.
[4:53] -Do you feel like
even in a case like that,
[4:55] Netanyahu's realizing
this isn't --
[4:57] this is a whole new rodeo?
[4:59] -Well, with world --
I think world leaders
[5:00] are always trying to adjust
to being with Trump.
[5:03] I mean, this was famous
during his first term
[5:05] where Boris Johnson
and Justin Trudeau
[5:08] were seen on camera
at a summit,
[5:11] kind of making fun of it
[5:13] because they'll do these
meetings with the world leaders.
[5:15] Reporters normally come in
for 30 seconds and then leave.
[5:18] But Trump would speak
for like an hour
[5:20] in front of the world leader
who's just sitting there
[5:22] while he's answering
questions on whatever.
[5:25] And you can always see the world
leaders' kind of, their faces.
[5:27] -Yeah.
[5:29] -And I was watching
Netanyahu the other night
[5:31] when Trump was talking
about the US taking over Gaza,
[5:33] which stunned a lot of people
in the room.
[5:35] I mean, reporters, you can --
you start to hear,
[5:37] like, the clicks on
the keyboard, like, going wild.
[5:41] But I was watching Netanyahu
looking at all the advisors,
[5:44] the faces,
like there in the front row,
[5:46] just kind of, you know,
[5:47] with this bewildered expression
on his face.
[5:49] -Yeah, 'cause that maybe
hadn't been a conversation
[5:51] that had previously happened
with the two of them.
[5:53] -I don't know if he realized how
much
[5:55] Trump was going to lean into it
in that press conference.
[5:57] -You asked about --
you had a good question,
[5:59] which is who will live in Gaza
after, you know,
[6:03] America takes it over
and owns it, to use his words.
[6:06] And he said, "World people."
[6:07] [ Laughter ]
[6:09] -And then he called it
the Riviera of the Middle East.
[6:10] -He called it the -- Yeah.
[6:12] And he said, "People are
going to think I'm a wise guy,
[6:14] but it's going to be
the Riviera of the Middle East."
[6:16] -I mean, Trump -- this has
always been the case with him,
[6:19] the eight years
that I've covered him.
[6:21] He views foreign policy
[6:23] with a real estate lens there
as well.
[6:25] I mean, his own advisors
will acknowledge this.
[6:28] And, you know,
he did it about North Korea.
[6:30] They talked about
oceanfront property there,
[6:32] and if the hermit kingdom
changed its ways
[6:35] and, you know,
let people use internet.
[6:37] And that was how he viewed Gaza,
[6:39] which, I mean, it's safe to say
I've been -- I talked to a bunch
[6:42] of Israeli officials that night
and Republican sources of mine
[6:45] throughout the day.
[6:46] They do not see it that way,
it's safe to say.
[6:49] But I mean,
he's the president,so...
[6:51] -He is the president.
Do you feel like...
[6:53] Because I feel like
in the first administration,
[6:55] we heard about how he's
a frustrating person, you know,
[6:59] even for his loyal staff,
[7:01] because they don't really know
what he's going to say.
[7:02] Do you feel like
his staff is caught off guard
[7:04] when he goes out and says,
"We're going to turn Gaza into,
[7:07] you know, a beautiful resort"?
[7:09] -I think they get
more used to it now,
[7:11] but it is, it's always
fascinating
[7:12] to watch and to see,
[7:14] because then they have to go out
and talk about it the next day.
[7:16] You know, Secretary of State
Marco Rubio
[7:18] was asked about it the next day.
[7:19] And that's
why I followed up with Trump,
[7:21] because this is a habit
of sometimes his aides --
[7:24] they walk back
or soften his statements.
[7:27] And that's why,
[7:29] you know, I asked him
who is going to be living there.
[7:31] What are you going to do with
the Palestinians,
[7:32] the millions of Palestinians
who do live there?
[7:34] Because it's really important
to see what he has to say
[7:37] about something,
[7:38] because, I mean,
he is truly the president
[7:39] who only speaks for himself.
[7:41] -As we talked about
earlier in the show, right?
[7:42] It seems like
Elon Musk is doing his best
[7:45] to dismantle
the federal government.
[7:46] What do you think?
[7:47] Is there any way
[7:48] to even guess what
their long-term plan is
[7:50] for the federal government
once they take it apart
[7:53] to the degree
which they seem to want to?
[7:54] -I think the question is what --
[7:56] Everything
that they're tearing down
[7:58] or trying to reduce
the federal workforce,
[8:00] what do they put there
instead?
[8:02] With USAID, you know,
[8:03] Trump's talking
about taking over Gaza.
[8:05] Well, if they're eliminating
USAID and wiping it out,
[8:08] that is humanitarian assistance
that goes to people like that.
[8:11] And so I think
that's a question.
[8:13] It's fascinating to watch,
though,
[8:15] how we're seeing this play out,
[8:17] because Trump really faces
no resistance or obstacles
[8:20] to carrying out his will,
[8:22] obviously not from Republicans
[8:24] and certainly not from
the Washington kind of...
[8:27] He knows Washington
and how it works now.
[8:28] The judiciary
has really been the only thing
[8:30] that's kind of stood in his way
with the federal workforce.
[8:33] And so we'll see what that
looks like and what happens.
[8:37] I mean, they offered everyone
at the CIA a buyout-style offer,
[8:40] which obviously is difficult
to do with the CIA, so...
[8:45] -Yeah, it does seem like you
don't, like, replace CIA people,
[8:48] like, right away.
[8:49] -But every day
it's something new.
[8:50] It's a different federal agency.
[8:52] And, you know,
the day of the inauguration,
[8:54] after Trump is inaugurated
and sworn in,
[8:56] he goes to this lunch
with Republicans.
[8:58] We went straight to
the White House,
[9:00] and we had been there for,
you know...
[9:02] Trump had been in office for
an hour and Elon Musk was there.
[9:04] We saw him on
the White House campus.
[9:05] And so his proximity is real.
[9:07] And, you know, he is there
and he is showing up everywhere
[9:10] and going to everything.
[9:12] -Trump seems fine with it.
[9:13] How do you feel
like the Trump staffers are
[9:15] with Elon's proximity
to the president?
[9:17] -I think they are
less enamored by it.
[9:20] And I mean, Trump
obviously is a huge fan of his
[9:23] and publicly praises him.
[9:25] I think they feel
like it's two planets
[9:28] kind of orbiting
around each other,
[9:30] because typically in both
of those universes,
[9:33] it's one person
who's the disrupter
[9:35] and that kind of the whole staff
is operating around.
[9:38] With Elon Musk in the picture,
it's Elon Musk AND Donald Trump
[9:41] who are kind of doing that.
[9:42] And I've heard from officials
who say,
[9:44] "We don't fully know
what Elon Musk is doing,
[9:47] or he's not reporting back
to us."
[9:49] And so they're
kind of learning about it
[9:51] sometimes in real time
with the rest of us.
[9:53] -That seems healthy.
[9:54] [ Laughter ]
[9:55] I feel like
that's the right way.
[9:56] If you, like, are running
the federal government,
[9:58] you want to kind of find out
from news alerts.
[10:01] -I don't know,
do you have a Tesla?
[10:02] -Yeah. No, no.
Do you...
[10:05] I think the first administration
was sort of famously leaky,
[10:08] which was probably
pretty helpful for journalists.
[10:10] Do you feel like
they've locked it up at all?
[10:12] -We are pro leak, for sure.
-You're pro leaks. Yeah.
[10:14] Do you feel like
the second Trump administration
[10:16] still has its same leakiness?
[10:18] -There's less of the warring
factions in the West Wing.
[10:22] They still exist,
[10:23] but not to the degree
[10:25] that was just so remarkable
in the first term.
[10:28] But I don't -- I mean,
it's not always leaking,
[10:31] but people just -- there's
so much happening
[10:32] and it's sometimes so bizarre,
[10:34] and people want to talk
about it.
[10:36] But I will say
it's better executed this time.
[10:39] I mean,
some people may see it and say
[10:41] this is chaos,
what's happening with the EO's,
[10:43] but it's thoughtful chaos
and it's planned out,
[10:47] and they're actually executing
on what they had planned to do
[10:49] for two months.
[10:51] -How do you...
Obviously your whole day is news
[10:53] and you have to deliver
the news.
[10:55] Like what do you watch when you
have like a second to yourself?
[10:57] Like, are you watching the news?
[10:59] Or do you give yourself,
like, some...
[11:00] -No, I just watch CNN honestly,
all day long.
[11:02] It's so pathetic.
[11:03] -How are you okay?
[ Laughter ]
[11:05] -I love -- I'm a news junkie!
Like...
[11:06] -Really? You don't have
any guilty pleasure TV?
[11:09] You're not like, watching,
[11:11] like murder docs on Netflix
or reality TV or anything?
[11:13] -I'm a huge
"Real Housewives" fan, but...
[11:16] [ Cheers and applause ]
Oh, I love this.
[11:17] -Yeah.
[11:19] -Um, but that's like,
[11:22] you know, I feel like I can't do
that during the week
[11:24] because you really
just can't be off your phone
[11:25] for like, an hour.
[11:26] You'll miss things.
-Yeah.
[11:28] And so, you know,
that's like my treat,
[11:30] like, maybe like once a month
or something.
[11:31] -Oh, my God.
-I know. It's sad.
[11:33] -Well, we appreciate
your dedication to the craft.
[11:35] We are all the beneficiaries
of it.
[11:36] Thanks so much for being back.
[11:38] It's always so great seeing you.
-Thanks for having me.
[11:39] -Kaitlan Collins, everybody.
