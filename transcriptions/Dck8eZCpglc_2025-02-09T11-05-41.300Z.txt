[0.0s] so you take the total business
[1.6s] investment of the United States divided
[3.1s] by the total number of workers in
[4.2s] America is 28 grand in Canada it's 15
[6.7s] grand the Canadian worker gets about 55
[9.0s] cents for every dollar of his American
[11.3s] and they're both measured in USD in
[13.0s] Vancouver more money goes to bureaucrats
[15.2s] than goes to the Carpenters electricians
[17.6s] and plumbers who build the place and to
[19.2s] add insult to injury trades people who
[21.4s] build homes can't afford to live in them
[23.4s] why is it that we're still importing oil
[25.2s] when we've got the world's third biggest
[26.7s] Supply why is it we can't export our
[28.8s] Natural Gas I think that was perhaps the
[31.2s] single stupidest thing I ever heard a
[32.9s] politician say your federal government
[35.2s] spent $66,000 of your fam's money going
[39.6s] over their budget they've squeezed the
[41.9s] taxpayer out of every last dime and
[44.2s] they're still 62 billion doll short it's
[47.1s] worse than that because I suspect that
[49.2s] the true picture is a lot more dismal
[51.6s] than we know okay so that's going to be
[53.5s] dumped on you sometime in the next year
[56.2s] they they get the party I get the
[57.5s] hangover eight years from now what is it
[60.0s] look
[62.2s] [Music]
[75.0s] like Hello
[77.1s] everybody I had the opportunity and the
[80.0s] privilege today to speak with Mr Pierre
[82.2s] POV who is the leader of Canada's
[85.8s] Federal conservative party but also
[89.0s] barring catastroph ropy and God willing
[91.6s] Canada's next prime minister um a
[94.4s] transition in power in this country is
[97.5s] likely to take place sometime between
[99.7s] March and October or November of
[103.8s] 2025 and it appears very probable that
[108.0s] Pierre POV is the air presumptive and
[111.3s] will be the next prime minister of
[112.8s] Canada and so I talked to Mr POV two and
[116.6s] a half years ago um which was quite
[119.2s] shocking to me I thought it had been
[120.6s] more recently than that and um a lot has
[124.2s] transpired in the in the meantime what
[127.2s] did I talk about with Pierre well I
[129.6s] think mostly what I did was give
[131.9s] Canadians and people on the
[134.0s] international side a chance to see who
[135.8s] this man is um in an hour and a half of
[138.5s] discussion and the extra half an hour on
[140.6s] the daily wire side you have enough time
[143.1s] to get a sense of how someone responds
[146.8s] spontaneously and emotionally and
[149.4s] cognitiv ly to complex and challenging
[152.4s] questions um in a manner that's not
[154.4s] rehearsed that's the huge advantage of
[156.4s] the podcast format we talked about all
[159.2s] the stories that all the stories that Mr
[162.3s] POV has heard in his thousands of event
[166.8s] interactions with Canadians in
[169.0s] industrial settings in manufacturing
[171.6s] settings in academic settings um so that
[175.3s] he could inform himself about the true
[177.5s] situation that's facing Canadian
[179.9s] struggling to make ends meet um despite
[182.5s] their best efforts now which is a dismal
[185.2s] reality in Canada with its excessive
[187.8s] housing prices and diminishing economy
[191.1s] most importantly perhaps what is his
[193.6s] vision of the future that um both
[196.3s] threatens and provides opportunity for
[198.6s] Canadians how is it possible for the
[201.1s] citizens of this great country to dig
[203.3s] themselves out of the Mala and pit that
[206.4s] has been dug for them and by them over
[209.2s] the last years and what could be done to
[212.7s] remove the impediments such that this
[215.1s] country could be become the dynamic
[217.2s] industrial Powerhouse that it certainly
[219.5s] could easily become so join us for all
[224.0s] that so sir it's been almost 2 and a
[227.6s] half years since we sat down to talk the
[231.0s] time before so I guess the first thing
[233.3s] I'd like to know is what have you been
[236.0s] doing during that time I'd like to I'd
[238.6s] like to hear I'd like to hear about your
[241.2s] day-to-day schedule and your week toe
[243.0s] schedule like lay out your job basically
[247.1s] uh we have two parts to my professional
[249.2s] life it's very uh bifurcated there's the
[252.4s] parliament Hillside which is you know
[255.0s] early morning meeting with my leadership
[256.6s] team house leader Deputy leader whip Etc
[260.8s] to plan out the day uh the battle plan
[263.4s] for our parliamentary committees
[265.3s] question period
[266.7s] Etc um that is punctuated by one one
[270.0s] weekly Caucus meeting and just the daily
[272.9s] prosecution of the government which is
[274.4s] the quintessential role of an opposition
[276.8s] leader and then the other part to my
[279.0s] life is touring
[281.0s] um I asked my assistant today how many
[283.9s] events we had done over the last year
[286.3s] and he said it was exactly 600 I a few
[289.9s] weeks ago was 570 something so we've
[293.0s] done six 100 events and those are like
[297.4s] tours at Mills mines factories Farms
[303.6s] high-tech facilities and I we tour in
[305.9s] see how the place operates then I give a
[308.8s] short speech do a question and answer
[310.6s] and then I just mul about and shake
[312.3s] hands with the workers
[314.3s] for 25 minutes to an hour and then I go
[316.9s] on to the next stop and do it all over
[318.4s] again and um we did that in nine
[322.2s] provinces and two territories uh this
[324.8s] year um and um and so that's a summary
[329.3s] of my workload and work
[332.2s] plan uh to uh to do my job and and you
[335.6s] said 600 events you you made illusion
[338.0s] when we were driving over here that the
[339.9s] weekends are particularly packed that
[341.7s] you'll do like 10 events on Saturday or
[343.9s] Sunday right and and so what a typical
[347.4s] event what do you enjoy about the events
[349.1s] why are they useful and and what do you
[350.6s] learn well first of all you get to you
[352.2s] get a
[354.0s] practical um insight into how the
[356.8s] country actually works like
[360.8s] um who makes the widgets how do those
[363.0s] get made how do um how does our supply
[366.2s] chain come together um what skill sets
[369.1s] do these incredible workers have what
[371.6s] background qualified them to be a
[374.6s] licensed welder or uh to run a CNC
[378.6s] machine or to be uh the CEO of a 300
[382.1s] person company that supplies um uh Parts
[387.0s] into the American economy um and that
[390.9s] practical Insight I think is important
[392.7s] if you want to lead a government uh and
[395.5s] uh a national economy so you you learn a
[397.9s] lot uh then I get to hear the stories of
[401.2s] the people who work in these places and
[404.0s] uh get their feedback on what they want
[406.0s] what their dreams and aspirations are
[409.4s] yeah I want to turn to that some in some
[411.4s] detail let me ask you about the
[413.0s] Parliamentary side too because I think
[415.1s] it'd be useful for people to
[417.4s] know how you prepare for your for what
[421.4s] you do in Parliament I don't it isn't
[424.5s] obvious to me that people exactly
[426.4s] understand the business of being in
[428.1s] opposition you know at a really
[429.9s] practical level how do you what do you
[432.5s] see as your major function I I know
[435.0s] you're there to to to push back against
[437.9s] the government and to question and
[439.6s] criticize but it isn't obvious how you
[442.4s] go about preparing for that or how you
[444.3s] decide what issues you're going to focus
[445.8s] on and how you distribute the
[447.4s] responsibilities among your your caucus
[450.0s] and your and your broader team so you
[453.4s] know it um there's a lot of discretion
[455.5s] you make up your mind when you wake up
[456.8s] in the morning you read the news you see
[459.6s] I have a a team that gives me a a full
[461.9s] briefing of all the the published news
[464.4s] from the mainstream media all the news
[466.3s] from the Independent and ethnic media
[468.7s] all a download of the entire social
[471.1s] media
[472.1s] landscape and then I respond to that by
[475.6s] saying well I think these are the we're
[476.9s] going to we have roughly 25 questions we
[479.0s] can ask and I'll say well we I want 10
[481.0s] on inflation and three on violent crime
[485.2s] and four uh on uh whatever the subject
[489.0s] happens to be in the day and I want this
[491.5s] committee to focus on this today and
[493.0s] that committee to focus on that today
[494.7s] and then our teams uh go out and we do
[497.8s] it and um the I've been very blessed
[501.0s] because my caucus is extremely talented
[503.1s] and they don't need a lot of Direction
[505.5s] but we've been acting in unison and I
[507.6s] think that's why our message is pumping
[509.2s] out so clearly to people it's not a
[511.8s] caffy of sound it's a clear drum beat um
[515.4s] and that's why people are hearing and
[517.8s] appreciating our message so you feel
[519.9s] that your party is well organized at the
[521.5s] moment extremely well organized okay so
[523.1s] what's your evidence for that by every
[525.9s] measure by every statistical measure uh
[529.1s] we're stronger than any political party
[531.3s] has been in well maybe in my lifetime um
[535.1s] objectively speaking memberships
[537.5s] fundraising poll numbers
[540.2s] right so people are positive are
[541.7s] positive in consequence of that so it's
[544.4s] it's a lot easier to lead an
[545.8s] organization when it's successful
[548.2s] obviously people are much more
[549.7s] enthusiastic why do you think you're in
[552.0s] that position what's going on that
[554.2s] that's that's setting the stage for that
[556.2s] and I don't just mean the failures on
[557.8s] the on the Trudeau side I mean what do
[560.4s] you think you guys are doing right well
[562.4s] we have a clear mission statement and
[564.5s] people know exactly why we're in this um
[567.1s] you know whenever someone asks me if
[569.4s] they say I I'm thinking of running for
[571.4s] Parliament or for mayor or some other
[574.2s] political position what's your advice
[576.2s] well I said well before I get to the
[577.5s] advice I have a very simple question why
[579.9s] do you want this
[581.3s] job and it might seem like a simplistic
[584.2s] question but it's actually the most
[585.8s] important question in life why why are
[588.4s] you doing what you're doing and our
[590.0s] answer to that is to bring back the
[594.2s] Canadian promise that anyone who works
[597.3s] hard gets uh a great paycheck and a
[600.8s] pension that buys them good food and a
[603.8s] nice home and a safe neighborhood that
[606.1s] anyone from anywhere can do anything and
[607.9s] that people are in charge of their own
[609.4s] lives that's effectively what we want to
[611.8s] deliver so every day when I'm in
[613.5s] Parliament so that's a very local Vision
[616.1s] in a sense right it doesn't have that
[618.2s] the grandiosity of an international
[620.3s] utopian vision for example very down to
[622.8s] earth I think people are sick and tired
[624.3s] of grandiosity uh in fact I think
[626.6s] there's uh something Grand about a
[628.7s] family that can uh take can go on a nice
[631.4s] road trip and share stories and build
[634.0s] lasting memories that the kids will
[636.2s] remember when they're 85 years old
[638.4s] despite producing all that nasty carbon
[640.2s] dioxide that's right I think but I think
[642.1s] those things are Grand and I think with
[643.6s] the problem we've had in this country
[645.0s] and in all of the countries that have
[646.9s] been afflect by this
[648.8s] horrendous uh utopian wokeism is that
[652.0s] it's been focused on the the grand um
[655.2s] the grandiosity of the leadership of the
[658.3s] egotistical person alities on top and
[660.6s] not the things that are Grand and great
[662.4s] about the common people and that is
[665.9s] another reason why I think we're doing
[667.1s] very well people are saying finally
[668.6s] there's someone who's focused on letting
[670.6s] me take back control of my own life and
[673.6s] create a a great future for my family um
[677.7s] and uh so that that is it to answer your
[680.4s] question one of the reasons why we've
[682.1s] had such incredible success over the
[684.5s] last two years in the beginning was the
[687.9s] word
[689.6s] Christ is a master at using short
[692.2s] mysterious stories they change the
[694.5s] listener who takes them
[696.8s] seriously my experience with the
[699.1s] biblical text is that they're
[701.0s] inexhaustible sources of wisdom if I
[703.0s] find something in them that is an
[704.4s] obstacle it's because there's something
[706.1s] in me that has yet to be transformed I
[708.6s] just don't get
[710.0s] it the person that you do not think
[712.3s] could ever be virtuous oh let me show
[714.4s] you this is the person who is fulfilling
[716.0s] the law and the prophets but seek first
[718.0s] his kingdom and his right ious and all
[720.7s] these things shall be added to you as
[722.2s] well I don't believe in that promise
[723.8s] I'll just be honest on this point that
[725.4s] has not been part of my experience this
[727.8s] Parable I've been trying to understand
[729.3s] forever while we were talking and while
[731.2s] we were sitting there then it hit me I
[733.2s] saw it made me one ideology that has
[736.0s] supplanted Christianity that has done
[738.6s] good for Humanity this Jew is very
[741.8s] frightened of a postchristian society he
[744.3s] was the god man the model the example of
[747.0s] what we ought to become and what we can
[748.8s] become it's okay it's safe for you in
[751.6s] all of your doubts and apprehensions to
[753.8s] open up and to let these stories in he
[756.2s] is the temple he is the Torah he is the
[758.5s] Covenant he is prophecy fulfilled if
[761.2s] you're doing this and it isn't also the
[763.4s] love of wisdom it's also an attempt at
[765.6s] wisdom without love in both ways you're
[767.2s] going radically wrong power of love it
[769.4s] sounds so cliche when you say 60 I don't
[772.2s] want to be in a homework I tell you
[775.1s] we've got our work cut out for us
[776.5s] gentlemen this is one peculiar time and
[779.6s] one peculiar text and I sure hope we're
[782.1s] up to the
[789.7s] task okay so there's a lot of
[792.4s] distrust generally speaking in
[795.5s] relationship to I would say
[798.5s] establishment organizations and
[801.1s] political Elites uh all across the West
[804.6s] a lot of that well-earned
[806.5s] um why should Canadians believe that the
[810.2s] vision that you just laid out is
[811.8s] something that you hold personally dear
[814.0s] and not merely a what would you say a
[816.8s] set of carefully calculated campaign
[819.3s] slogans well I look back at everything
[821.9s] I've done for my entire political career
[824.7s] uh to the time I was a teenager you know
[827.0s] some people have even dug up my old uh
[830.5s] University essays and I've been saying
[833.1s] precisely the same thing the entire time
[836.5s] um you know when I was 20 I wrote an
[838.2s] essay as Prime Minister I would and the
[840.3s] title was building Canada on freedom the
[842.4s] entire piece was about making the
[843.8s] government small and maximizing personal
[847.1s] freedom so that's basically what I'm
[849.0s] doing now so there's you have
[850.7s] consistency there things when I launched
[852.6s] my leadership race I literally had same
[855.1s] language in my leadership launch speech
[857.6s] that I had put in that essay 22 or 23
[861.8s] years earlier um and when I was part of
[864.5s] the Harper government uh we basically
[867.3s] fought for and did the same thing things
[869.5s] then that I'm proposing to do
[872.0s] now so as much as you can be ass assured
[875.8s] uh of anything any political leader says
[878.4s] um I've got evidence to back it up okay
[881.0s] so one of the things that's been very
[883.3s] distressing to observe I would say and
[885.7s] I'm going to use the UK as an example I
[887.7s] mean the UK had 14 straight years of
[890.5s] conservative uh government yeah and you
[893.2s] know as far as I'm concerned thank God
[894.9s] for that because it could have been
[895.9s] labor but having said that they fall
[899.1s] they fell 100% prey to the blandishments
[902.0s] of the Net Zero types and brought
[903.9s] forward really a catastrophic energy
[906.2s] policy and yeah the UK is suffering
[908.4s] dreadfully for that and their
[910.0s] immigration policy I mean kir starmer
[912.8s] apologized for it which was something
[914.6s] remarkable to behold and so did kemy
[916.9s] badnor who now runs the conservatives in
[919.0s] the UK now the reason I'm bringing them
[920.6s] up as an example is because well they
[923.4s] were a conservative government and they
[925.0s] certainly didn't govern by anything
[926.5s] approximating conservative principles
[928.1s] and so how do
[930.3s] you H how do you feel about the
[933.1s] probability that if the conservatives in
[935.2s] Canada take power that they'll be
[937.6s] enticed into this Global utopian
[940.2s] delusion that seems to have enveloped so
[942.2s] many so many leaders kind of regardless
[945.1s] of their political stripe what do you
[946.9s] think if anything can inoculate you or
[949.4s] has inoculated you against
[952.1s] that I know
[954.1s] better well elaborate what do you mean
[957.0s] I'm not going to do that um and it will
[958.7s] be hard because the Temptation will be
[961.0s] this is the mistake that conservative
[962.8s] parties around the world have made
[964.5s] countless times they think well anybody
[967.7s] who's got a conservative mindset is
[969.2s] already voting for me so I can go off
[971.0s] and Chase um the ideas of my uh
[974.3s] political opponents and and then
[975.9s] everyone will love me because I'll have
[977.8s] the conservatives due to the fact that I
[979.4s] have the name conservative and then I'll
[981.7s] have all these other people because I've
[983.6s] embraced their contrary
[986.8s] Direction and in the short term it works
[989.7s] because you're you you managed to have
[992.1s] all of these people under and all of the
[995.3s] different
[996.2s] political um ideologies captured in one
[999.2s] tent but the problem happens when the
[1001.6s] policies are a
[1003.4s] disaster and then people wake up and go
[1005.7s] oh my God my taxes are now up my in the
[1008.0s] inflation is out of control the deficit
[1009.8s] is spiraling there's crime on the
[1011.5s] streets so it would does the Temptation
[1015.8s] exist to try and uh take on the the
[1019.4s] political policies of uh the Socialists
[1024.5s] in the the short term sure but it's one
[1027.0s] that I will fiercely resist because I
[1029.2s] know that by the fourth year of my
[1031.5s] mandate people would be enraged because
[1034.1s] their lives would be even worse so it
[1037.1s] will be tough though like it's going to
[1038.4s] be trade off the Temptation I mean I
[1040.4s] think many of many leaders fall prey to
[1042.8s] the temptation to shine on the
[1044.9s] international stage right I mean I can't
[1047.7s] remember who it was in the UK I believe
[1050.2s] it was the previous labor party leader
[1052.5s] who said that decisions in Westminister
[1054.9s] were essentially irrelevant because all
[1056.9s] the important things were happening
[1058.5s] internationally right and so if people
[1061.2s] are involved in status climbing and they
[1063.3s] hit the national Pinnacle always then
[1065.6s] there's the international world to you
[1067.6s] know what would you say to dominate or
[1069.8s] to to impress and that's I think that
[1073.1s] the power of that Temptation or even of
[1075.0s] that peer pressure can't be
[1077.0s] underestimated so okay so now you've
[1079.3s] been these events these 600 events that
[1082.2s] you've gone to so let's say that's
[1084.4s] something approximating 1,000 to 1200
[1086.8s] since we last talked you spent a lot of
[1089.3s] time speaking to and I presume listening
[1093.0s] to ordinary Canadians I heard you made a
[1095.0s] speech in the heard you make a speech in
[1097.2s] the House of Commons that went viral in
[1098.8s] the last couple of weeks and you spoke
[1100.9s] very persuasively on behalf of
[1102.8s] workingclass Canadians and so tell us
[1106.0s] what you've tell us what you've learned
[1108.3s] what you've heard over the last couple
[1109.8s] of years and how that's shaped you and
[1111.6s] changed you let's say as you've moved
[1113.8s] from well as you as you shifted your
[1117.0s] position up the political hierarchy and
[1119.3s] and are po poised really likely to take
[1121.7s] the Reigns in Canada at some point in
[1123.5s] the next year you've listen to all these
[1125.6s] people and so what have you learned and
[1127.7s] and and what has it made you convinced
[1131.0s] of let's say well first of all
[1135.0s] people there's the bad news and the good
[1137.1s] news the bad news is that people feel
[1139.5s] like uh they've done absolutely
[1141.8s] everything right and their lives are uh
[1146.3s] trapped they you know young people say
[1149.8s] look okay I went through I got an
[1152.6s] education I work
[1154.7s] Non-Stop and I have made the calculation
[1157.8s] that there is no mathematical path for
[1160.8s] me to own a house it's just not possible
[1163.5s] in Toronto here for example if you take
[1166.4s] the average income and the average house
[1168.2s] price
[1169.3s] it would take use 29 years to save up
[1172.3s] for a down payment so you know if you uh
[1176.0s] for a down payment for down payment not
[1177.6s] to pay it off forget paying it off um
[1180.7s] and so if you're a young woman who's got
[1182.7s] a biological clock obviously we do the
[1184.9s] math you know you start off at let's say
[1187.5s] you're
[1188.4s] 25 well you're going to be in your 50s
[1191.4s] before you can afford the average house
[1193.3s] so how you ever going to have kids um
[1196.4s] and and that's about the time when
[1197.8s] people think about downsizing from their
[1199.7s] house that's what they used to think
[1201.0s] about downsizing and you know they
[1202.8s] usually had their house paid off back by
[1205.6s] the time they were in their early 50s so
[1207.6s] just to show how how dreadfully things
[1210.0s] have worsened um that's this the picture
[1213.2s] of the youth uh then there's the the the
[1215.4s] kind of middle-aged people who do have
[1217.1s] kids already and they're terrified of
[1219.0s] the dangers in the streets I mean our
[1220.7s] streets are just being overtaken by
[1222.3s] drugs and
[1223.6s] gangsterism um and uh other dangers and
[1227.7s] they want safety again um and then you
[1231.3s] have business owners that are saying
[1232.8s] there's just no way to continue to
[1234.3s] compete in Canada uh we have to look at
[1237.6s] moving and that means the next 200 jobs
[1240.4s] we create is going to be in Ohio or
[1243.5s] Florida or some other place than Canada
[1246.9s] uh that's the kind of overview that I
[1249.1s] that I get the good news though is that
[1253.0s] people do now have some hope they think
[1255.0s] that things can be turned around and
[1257.3s] they theyve clearly and correctly
[1259.4s] diagnosed the problem which is entirely
[1262.4s] political there is no there is no
[1265.2s] physical
[1266.7s] Geographic um reason why Canada should
[1270.8s] struggle to to supply people with great
[1273.7s] opportunities of home ownership and
[1276.6s] family formation in fact we should be
[1279.0s] the richest country in the world and
[1282.1s] people increasingly know that and they
[1284.4s] know that if we make the right albeit
[1287.0s] difficult political decision
[1289.3s] that they will once again be able to do
[1291.3s] as their parents did which is to say get
[1293.2s] a house start a family uh live in a safe
[1296.1s] neighborhood raise their kids with good
[1298.6s] Traditional Values that's another thing
[1300.9s] I'm finding is that a lot of people um
[1303.3s] are really getting back to the those
[1305.4s] values that we were told were
[1307.4s] unfashionable um they they they want you
[1310.1s] know young people today they want to
[1311.7s] have families they yeah well there's
[1313.8s] been a real conservative swing
[1315.3s] especially among young men well no
[1317.8s] wonder because been demonized for what
[1319.9s] 30 straight years for every aspect of
[1322.2s] their masculinity from their play
[1323.8s] preferences to their proclivity to
[1326.2s] destroy the planet with their ambition
[1328.5s] and so there's definitely a an
[1330.7s] opportunity there and clearly your
[1333.6s] political party and you are capitalizing
[1335.7s] on that that you have the support from
[1338.2s] from from young people increasingly
[1340.5s] right across cada we are winning among
[1342.2s] youth uh in fact the youth were the
[1343.7s] first to come on board with me my
[1346.0s] rallies were overwhelmingly populated
[1348.2s] with youth youth which is not normal for
[1350.8s] conservatives and the reason is is
[1352.9s] because in your youth of course you you
[1355.5s] as you write it people young people want
[1357.4s] to have the adventure of their lives
[1359.0s] they want to go uh into uh the
[1361.9s] Wilderness and um earn a living and
[1365.2s] bring it home and raise kids have a
[1368.2s] purpose that's bigger than just
[1371.2s] short-term um short-termism and uh I
[1374.9s] think you know 20 years ago the
[1377.7s] Socialists would go to university
[1379.3s] campuses and say vote for us and we'll
[1381.0s] let you be a kid forever you we'll give
[1383.8s] you free stuff and uh you never you'll
[1386.8s] never have to get a job and that was
[1388.3s] very temporarily popular Across the
[1390.6s] Western world but then young people woke
[1393.0s] up and found out this was not a Utopia
[1395.2s] it was a total dystopia and that all the
[1397.8s] things that they really valued and
[1399.5s] wanted for their lives were impossible
[1402.0s] when they were being borne down upon by
[1404.1s] this massive State um they've learned
[1407.0s] that that that but that help is the
[1409.8s] Sunny Side of control and and um and so
[1414.4s] now young people are and I love this
[1416.3s] this is great news our young people are
[1418.0s] saying I want to start a business I want
[1419.6s] to invent something I want to create
[1422.5s] things I I want to become a a Tradesman
[1425.3s] and then when I I get when I get good
[1427.5s] enough at that I want to hire five other
[1429.4s] Tradesmen and by the time I retire I
[1431.4s] want to have 300 employees and and then
[1433.2s] I want to give that company to my kids
[1435.8s] um these are the stories that I hear
[1437.3s] when I go out and about about in Canada
[1439.8s] and um the great news is we can have all
[1442.0s] those things that's the optimistic
[1444.4s] message that I have for people we've got
[1448.0s] a limitless supply of resources here
[1450.5s] we're like a cornucopia you know the the
[1453.0s] third biggest supply of oil fifth
[1454.6s] biggest supply of natural gas biggest
[1456.3s] supply of uranium fifth biggest supply
[1458.3s] of lithium we've got not one not two not
[1461.2s] three but four coasts to tied water
[1464.9s] right um we we live next to the biggest
[1469.1s] military and economic superpower the
[1471.4s] world has ever seen we have a highly
[1473.6s] educated population and the best system
[1477.4s] of system of government in the history
[1480.0s] of the world the parliamentary system um
[1482.6s] not the best government but the best
[1484.0s] system of government so all these
[1485.7s] massive advantages uh we just need to
[1488.4s] unleash that potential right so the
[1490.5s] unhappiness that you're seeing among
[1492.1s] young people seems to me to be a
[1494.3s] consequence of the mismatch between the
[1496.4s] opportunity they see right in front of
[1498.2s] them
[1498.9s] and their FR at
[1500.6s] theity can't be capitalized even if
[1503.6s] they're contributing
[1505.6s] their and they're definitely doing their
[1508.0s] part like they really are you know
[1510.0s] there's of it's always been a habit of
[1512.8s] older people to say you know oh the
[1514.6s] youth these days when I look at the
[1516.7s] young people
[1517.8s] today all they do is work I am
[1520.8s] astonished when I when I meet Young
[1522.7s] University students how much they work
[1525.8s] outside of their studies just to to
[1528.7s] scrape by how many hours of Labor they
[1531.4s] do as waitresses or um in another
[1535.4s] service job so that they can pay their
[1537.2s] bills way more than when I was a student
[1539.4s] you know 25 years I was a kid in
[1542.3s] Alberta I could work in the summer and I
[1544.6s] didn't work on the rig so I didn't have
[1546.3s] one of the high paying jobs I had a more
[1549.4s] what would you say a job that was
[1550.7s] secondarily associated with the re with
[1553.0s] the resource economy I could make enough
[1555.2s] money in the summer in 2 months 4 months
[1558.8s] to pay for the tuition and my entire
[1562.0s] year's rent of course right right right
[1564.5s] and uh now the these kids are working 20
[1567.6s] 30 hours a week in addition to a full
[1570.4s] course load and they they look exhausted
[1573.3s] when I meet young people today they are
[1574.7s] exhausted they have bags under their
[1576.2s] eyes and all they do is work and they
[1578.8s] the worst part about it is not that
[1580.2s] they're working all the time it's that
[1581.8s] they don't see a light at the end of the
[1585.9s] tunnel are you tired of feeling sluggish
[1588.4s] down or just not your best self take
[1590.3s] control of your health and vitality
[1591.9s] today with balance of nature with
[1593.6s] balance of nature there's never been a
[1595.0s] more convenient dietary supplement to
[1596.8s] ensure you get a wide variety of fruits
[1598.3s] and vegetables every day balance of
[1600.2s] nature takes fruits and vegetables they
[1601.8s] freeze dry them turn them into a powder
[1603.8s] and then they put them into a capsule
[1605.6s] the capsules are completely void of
[1607.0s] additives fillers extracts synthetics
[1609.4s] pesticides or added sugar the only thing
[1611.7s] in balance of nature fruit and veggie
[1613.2s] capsules are fruits and veggies right
[1615.4s] now you can order with promo code Jordan

[1633.1s] code Jordan for 35% off your first
[1635.1s] preferred order plus a free bottle of
[1637.2s] fiber and
[1639.0s] spice well that's a genuine breakdown of
[1641.6s] the social contract right because the
[1643.5s] deal like you said the deal was supposed
[1644.9s] to be if you do things right you'll be
[1647.5s] rewarded yes right and that's the
[1650.5s] intergenerational compact essentially
[1653.0s] and there isn't anything that defines
[1655.0s] hopelessness more clearly than seeing
[1658.9s] that if you do all the right things the
[1660.6s] pathway is paved to failure right right
[1663.2s] so that's so demoralizing and you know
[1665.6s] what's even worse about that is that the
[1667.8s] people who are most demoralized by that
[1669.7s] are precisely the people who would be
[1671.3s] most productive and hardworking cuz the
[1673.4s] ones that are sponging along they don't
[1675.1s] give a damn anyways right it's they're
[1677.0s] not losing any Glory future and they're
[1679.2s] not sacrificing for it anyways but it's
[1681.5s] it's really not good when your economy
[1683.4s] is set up to punish people who are
[1685.0s] entrepreneurial and hardw working and
[1687.0s] that's what it does right now okay so so
[1688.5s] let's let's delve into that a little bit
[1690.3s] so I've been tracking economic
[1694.2s] statistics in relationship to Canada and
[1696.5s] sort of left me open-mouthed in
[1698.6s] amazement at our dismal condition so
[1702.0s] from what I've been able to understand
[1704.5s] the richest people per capita in terms
[1707.6s] of GDP per person um gross domestic
[1711.5s] product per person so that's total
[1713.2s] productivity is
[1715.0s] Ontario and uh Ontario inhabitants are
[1719.3s] now poorer per capita than inhabitants
[1721.7s] of Mississippi and that's the poorest
[1724.0s] American state so the inhabitants of
[1726.3s] Canada's richest Province are poorer
[1728.7s] than the inhabitants of the United
[1730.6s] States poorest state and that's actually
[1735.0s] occurred
[1736.6s] primarily in the last 10 years yes and
[1741.2s] because we were basically at parody
[1743.1s] before that and had historically been
[1746.1s] not quite as rich as the Americans with
[1748.5s] some you know blips above them but
[1752.2s] pretty much tracking them one to1 and
[1754.9s] now it's 60% something like that and
[1758.9s] that's and that's not all the bad news
[1761.0s] because it's 60% in terms of a absolute
[1764.7s] wealth and a real estate market that's
[1767.4s] twice as expensive approximately on
[1769.7s] average yeah right so now it's really
[1773.7s] bad it's really incredible like 10 years
[1775.8s] ago the New York Times wrote an article
[1779.1s] uh welcome to Canada home of the world's
[1782.4s] most affluent middle class and in that
[1784.7s] article the times had calculated that
[1787.2s] median American and Canadian incomes
[1789.5s] were tied and that Canadians were
[1791.7s] slightly better off now part of that was
[1794.4s] because the 09 0809 financial crisis hit
[1797.4s] them harder than than it hit us but
[1799.2s] still now per capita GDP in the states
[1803.1s] is
[1804.2s] $22,000 higher than in Canada measured
[1807.7s] in USD that's about almost 30,000
[1810.6s] measured in right so that's a whole
[1812.2s] other income essentially that's a whole
[1813.8s] other part-time in exactly and um and
[1817.0s] then to as you correctly point out their
[1819.1s] real estate is significantly cheaper
[1821.8s] than ours so their their dollars go a
[1825.2s] lot further even when you match up the
[1827.6s] exchange rates um and what's worse than
[1831.0s] that is that the leading indicators are
[1833.2s] even more horrific and leading
[1835.0s] indicators for example are investment
[1837.3s] dollars because your wealth tomorrow is
[1839.9s] determined by your investment today so
[1842.8s] if your employer for example is buying
[1845.4s] lots of new tools and Technology you're
[1847.4s] going to be able to crank out more
[1849.6s] widgets um so you crank out those
[1852.2s] widgets then you can ultimately make
[1854.1s] more income down the
[1856.0s] road if you take business investment and
[1859.5s] divide it by the number of workers the
[1862.8s] American worker gets
[1865.1s] $228,000 of investment measured in US
[1867.8s] Dollars this is per capita per worker
[1870.3s] per year per worker per member of the
[1872.1s] labor force okay so you take the total
[1874.2s] business investment of the United States
[1875.7s] divided by the total number of workers
[1877.1s] in America is 28 grand in Canada it's 15
[1880.2s] grand so we got the Canadian worker gets
[1882.6s] about 55 cents for every dollar of his
[1885.7s] American and they're both measured in
[1887.2s] USD so how is the Canadian that's
[1890.6s] investment in future productivity that's
[1892.4s] investment in um in machines and
[1895.3s] Technology warehouses factories um I see
[1899.5s] any any capital investment that
[1901.7s] businesses make divided by the number of
[1904.4s] workers that's the measurement so now
[1906.9s] that means they're getting better
[1909.0s] technology better um new machines uh
[1913.5s] better tools than our workers and they
[1915.5s] will be able to crank out even greater
[1918.0s] wages for their people than we will
[1919.7s] unless we catch up with that um our
[1922.9s] productivity is another major problem
[1925.3s] like right now uh and that's
[1927.1s] productivity sounds complicated it's
[1928.5s] actually extremely simple you just take
[1930.3s] the GDP and you divide it by The Hours
[1932.2s] worked in the country so American GDP is
[1936.3s] $80 so for every hour an American Worker
[1939.7s] Works on average he produ he or she
[1942.3s] produces $80 of GDP of GDP in Canada
[1946.4s] it's 50 so that's every hour so that
[1949.6s] means we have to work 60% more just to
[1952.9s] make the same amount uh and have the
[1955.5s] same level of uh income to buy food and
[1958.7s] housing so that that's the now that
[1960.9s] sounds like a bunch of wonk speak that
[1962.6s] should all might seem like it only
[1964.4s] matters to someone staring at a
[1966.7s] spreadsheet or a graph or a chart but in
[1970.3s] fact that's reflected in the fact that
[1972.6s] our two million people are lined up at
[1974.4s] food banks because they can't afford
[1975.8s] food and uh 80% of youth can't afford
[1978.8s] homes and um our quality of life is and
[1982.4s] the things we can afford to provide our
[1984.0s] kids have fallen back so much there
[1986.6s] pretty Stark and easily comprehensible
[1989.0s] statistic I mean if you work and you
[1991.6s] produce $80 worth of goods and services
[1994.7s] in an hour compared to working and
[1996.6s] producing 50 obviously that's a
[1999.4s] substantial shortfall yeah so and is
[2003.3s] that is there a Starker indicator of the
[2006.3s] economic disparity between the US in
[2008.1s] Canada than that or do you think that's
[2010.3s] the primary
[2011.7s] statistic I mean I think housing costs
[2014.0s] are another one I mean there was a study
[2016.2s] out just uh 10 days ago that has Toronto
[2020.3s] and Vancouver now by far the most
[2022.6s] unaffordable housing markets in North
[2025.1s] America and so you know housing costs
[2028.6s] are 50% higher in Toronto than they are
[2032.0s] in Chicago even though Chicago workers
[2034.8s] make 50% more money uh the same is true
[2038.3s] between Vancouver and Seattle Seattle
[2041.0s] workers make way more than Vancouver
[2043.8s] workers but housing is 60 or 70% more
[2047.3s] expensive in Vancouver so uh on on all
[2051.8s] the me less by a lot by a lot by a lot
[2056.6s] yeah and we're we're paying more paying
[2058.9s] more by a lot right and most of that's
[2061.8s] transpired in the last 10 years yes and
[2063.8s] we're paying the difference by
[2065.4s] accumulating enormous quantities of debt
[2068.8s] our our households are by far the most
[2071.2s] indebted in the G7 uh when you take you
[2074.6s] divide total household debt by GDP we
[2077.4s] now have a bigger stock of of household
[2079.7s] debt than our entire economy um we are
[2082.6s] more indebted as households than the
[2084.3s] Americans were right before the 08
[2087.0s] financial
[2088.4s] crisis and um so what we have as a
[2091.2s] modeling Canada is we have artificial
[2093.4s] scarcity imposed by a very heavy and
[2095.6s] restrictive state confiscatory state
[2099.6s] that suppresses production MH but in
[2102.9s] order to allow for consumption we print
[2105.6s] money and borrow money and then flood
[2109.1s] the economy with that money okay so
[2110.6s] that's another problem so that's the
[2112.2s] inflationary problem yes now the problem
[2114.4s] with inflation there's many problems
[2116.4s] with inflation but one of them is that
[2118.0s] it particularly punishes people who are
[2120.7s] thrifty and who save yes right right so
[2123.9s] inflation P punishes the people who
[2126.6s] forgo Gra
[2128.2s] to invest in the future that's right
[2130.2s] right so that's a very bad idea it's a
[2132.1s] horri inflation is the single most in
[2134.9s] immoral tax for so many reasons one it
[2137.8s] takes from Savers and people who are
[2140.8s] trying to be be responsible thus making
[2143.8s] it impossible to be responsible because
[2146.2s] you will if you if you refuse to to play
[2148.6s] the inflation game of borrowing money to
[2150.6s] buy things you can't afford someone else
[2152.5s] inevitably will and you won't be able to
[2154.2s] afford anything um so you ultimately
[2157.4s] have have to act irresponsibly it's like
[2159.7s] Milton Freeman was asked what would you
[2161.3s] do with your money in times of inflation
[2163.2s] he said spend it right like the first
[2165.4s] thing you want to do when inflation is
[2166.8s] out of control is to make sure you get
[2168.5s] rid of this thing that's losing its
[2170.4s] value the second reason it's immoral is
[2172.7s] it takes from the poor because the
[2174.8s] poorest people cannot put they do not
[2177.1s] have the ability to buy inflation prooof
[2179.4s] assets like gold and real estate and
[2181.8s] fancy watches and art Collections and
[2183.8s] wine B uh fancy wines and things that go
[2186.8s] up with with or even exceed inflation so
[2189.4s] it's a very big wealth transfer from the
[2191.6s] half to the from the from the poor to
[2194.0s] and the working class to the very very
[2196.4s] wealthy a very small group of people
[2198.3s] actually get richer so the Socialist
[2200.3s] policies that um provide goods and
[2203.2s] services to Canadians let's say or
[2205.7s] denans of other countries by printing
[2207.8s] money actually punish the poor brutally
[2210.8s] Absol in consequence of the inflation
[2212.8s] that they generate yes I mean all the
[2215.2s] Socialist policies in practice take
[2218.0s] redistribute from the working class to
[2220.2s] the super wealthy in practice and I can
[2222.8s] prove that again and again again in
[2225.9s] practice Yeah in
[2227.7s] practice uh in practice they with the
[2230.3s] all the redistribution that happens in
[2232.1s] the so-called socialist countries
[2234.3s] ultimately goes from the working class
[2236.7s] to the super wealthy that is the real
[2239.5s] okay so but just one last thing on
[2241.0s] inflation the the the final reason why
[2243.0s] it's so immoral is nobody votes on it
[2245.2s] the basic principle of our parliamentary
[2247.2s] system system is the government can't
[2249.3s] tax what Parliament has not voted the
[2253.0s] people must no taxation without
[2254.9s] representation right but no one ever
[2257.7s] votes to have the money printing happen
[2262.2s] and so the inflation is adopted secretly
[2267.6s] and you blame the grocer because
[2269.4s] groceries are more expensive or your
[2271.1s] local gas station because gas is more or
[2273.4s] your realtor because house in fact it
[2275.4s] was actually the government that bid up
[2277.0s] all of the those things with money
[2278.3s] Printing and you didn't even know about
[2279.6s] it so it is silent it's a silent Thief
[2283.4s] that takes from the poor it gives to the
[2285.0s] richest people um and it destroys the
[2287.7s] working class uh and that's why I am I
[2290.7s] want to crush inflation we need a policy
[2293.1s] that seeks to just to stop inflation at
[2296.0s] all at all costs okay so what would you
[2298.1s] do to to stop inflation well we stop the
[2300.2s] money printing you know we need a we
[2302.7s] need and and the money printing is just
[2305.4s] a means to fund deficit spend MH
[2308.9s] governments borrow Define the deficit
[2312.0s] yeah for people so basically the deficit
[2313.7s] is the difference between what the
[2316.0s] government spends and what it brings in
[2318.2s] it's usually calculated on a yearly
[2319.8s] basis the Y and the debt well the debt
[2322.8s] is just the accumulation of the deficits
[2324.6s] right right so the deficit right now is
[2327.5s] $62
[2329.0s] billion and I thought it had a ceiling
[2331.4s] of of 41 billion yeah wasn't that a
[2334.0s] ceiling yes not e I guess not um and um
[2338.8s] look there are very real present-day
[2340.8s] consequences for that deficits increase
[2343.5s] the money supply uh central banks
[2346.0s] effectively facilitate that increase in
[2348.2s] the money supply and that causes
[2351.2s] inflation and uh you know it's it's why
[2355.3s] our you know I have a buddy who's whose
[2357.6s] family moved here from Italy back in
[2360.6s] 1973 his father worked Paving roads um
[2364.6s] and his mother made sandwiches in a
[2366.1s] Senior's home they were able to pay off
[2369.8s] their home 10 minutes from Parliament
[2372.6s] Hill in seven
[2375.0s] years right their grandchildren wouldn't
[2377.9s] be able to save up a down payment for
[2379.9s] that home in 15 years and they will be
[2382.7s] University educated with all the
[2384.1s] advantages of having been here two
[2385.5s] decades that is the consequence of the
[2388.2s] money supply growing vastly quicker than
[2390.8s] the stuff that money Buys so we have to
[2393.0s] do is stop growing the money supply and
[2395.6s] start growing the stuff money buys
[2398.1s] right produce more energy grow more food
[2401.0s] build more homes we have to unleash the
[2403.0s] free enterprise system to produce more
[2406.6s] stuff of value um and this is where we
[2409.6s] have to remove the artificial and
[2412.1s] scarcity that the government is imposing
[2414.4s] on the population let's um incentivize
[2417.3s] our municipalities to Grant the fastest
[2420.2s] building permits in the world to build
[2423.3s] homes um and you have a plan for that in
[2426.0s] principle yes I mean I'm going to say to
[2427.7s] the municipal governments they either
[2429.2s] they either speed up permits cut
[2431.7s] development charges and free up land or
[2434.5s] they will lose their Federal
[2435.8s] infrastructure money so they will have a
[2437.6s] powerful kotan stick uh incentive to
[2440.8s] speed up home building and the
[2442.6s] percentage of a new house price that's a
[2445.0s] consequence of government Taxation and
[2447.2s] regulation well in Vancouver it's 60%
[2450.4s] 60% does that include the land and the
[2453.4s] house yes that includes everything so
[2455.9s] I'll tell you how they calculate it CD
[2458.2s] how took the cost of building a compar
[2461.5s] the cost of building a home to the cost
[2462.9s] of buying a home yeah and he said what's
[2464.8s] the gap between those two things so they
[2466.4s] added up land labor profit for the
[2469.8s] developer materials and they compared
[2472.8s] that to the sale price and they found
[2474.9s] the Gap was
[2476.2s] $1.2
[2479.2s] Million so that's $1.2 million of extra
[2482.7s] cost above and beyond the materials the
[2485.2s] labor the land and the profit for the
[2487.6s] developer so where's that going well the
[2489.4s] answer is development
[2491.7s] charges um sales taxes land transfer
[2495.3s] taxes uh the the delays in getting the
[2498.1s] permit time is money um the Consultants
[2501.4s] lawyers accountants lobbyists that the
[2504.1s] developer has to hire in order to get
[2506.0s] the approval that so in other words
[2508.0s] we're spending twice in Vancouver we
[2510.8s] spend twice as much on
[2513.7s] bureaucrats than we do on all other
[2516.6s] things combined to build a home more
[2518.2s] money goes to bureaucrats than goes to
[2519.9s] the Carpenters electricians and plumbers
[2522.4s] who build the place and to add insult
[2524.8s] injury those trades people who build
[2528.2s] homes can't afford to live in them right
[2530.4s] I mean it is so what we need to is Slash
[2532.4s] the bureaucracy and I'm going to I'm
[2534.6s] going to say to the Mayors you're not
[2535.9s] getting Federal infrastructure money
[2537.5s] until you slash your development charges
[2539.4s] speed up your permits I'm going to take
[2541.2s] the federal GST off new homes uh under a
[2544.9s] certain limit and encourage the
[2546.6s] provinces to do the same but we've got
[2549.3s] so much land we we should have the most
[2553.4s] affordable housing in the
[2555.6s] world we have it should be Dirt Cheap
[2557.7s] because we have the most dirt we just
[2560.2s] need to get the government out of the
[2561.5s] way the same goes for our resource
[2563.5s] sector me why is it that we're still
[2565.3s] importing oil when we've got the world's
[2567.0s] third biggest Supply why is it we can't
[2569.1s] export our natural gas uh overseas you
[2572.0s] mean like to Germany and Japan even when
[2574.0s] they ask offering multi- deade
[2577.8s] made contracts at at at distressed
[2582.0s] prices because they're so desperate for
[2583.8s] energy right and we can't make a
[2585.6s] business case for that famously yes this
[2588.8s] is the I think that was perhaps the
[2590.8s] single stupidest thing I ever heard a
[2592.5s] politician say and that's a really hard
[2594.5s] contest to
[2596.3s] win as we celebrate the gift of life you
[2598.9s] have an opportunity to share the same
[2600.4s] gift with a mother and her baby imagine
[2602.3s] a young woman facing an unplanned
[2603.7s] pregnancy feeling alone and unsure of
[2605.4s] what to do she's searching for hope and
[2607.4s] that's where pre-born Ministries comes
[2608.8s] in Dianna already had eight children and
[2611.0s] was in a tumultuous marriage the thought
[2612.9s] of another child was more than she could
[2614.4s] bear she tried to order the abortion
[2616.2s] pill but by God's design it never came
[2618.3s] at 18 weeks along Diana visited a
[2620.0s] pre-born network Clinic while getting
[2621.6s] her sonogram her baby waved at her then
[2624.1s] she remembered that this was the baby
[2625.6s] that she had asked God for God saved her
[2627.4s] baby that day and he also saved her for
[2629.5s] just $28 you can help save life and
[2632.4s] thanks to a special matching Grant your
[2634.0s] gift is doubled just $28 provides one
[2636.5s] ultrasound 140 sponsors 5 that means
[2639.0s] your 140 gift becomes 280 potentially
[2641.3s] helping 10 mothers and their unborn
[2642.8s] children to support this vital work D
[2645.1s] pound 250 and say the keyword baby
[2647.1s] that's pound 250 keyword baby or visit

[2652.3s] four-star charity rating and all gifts
[2654.1s] are tax deductible join us in supporting
[2656.2s] this crucial work visit preborn tocom
[2662.1s] jordant well if you look at the the
[2664.3s] price of natural gas is 3 to five times
[2667.8s] higher in both Europe and Asia than it
[2669.9s] is in North America which means there's
[2672.0s] a hell of a lot of profit to Arbitrage
[2674.1s] in getting our product over there in the
[2677.0s] last um the last 10 years the Americans
[2680.7s] have added I think six liquefaction
[2683.7s] plants the qaris have massively
[2687.3s] increased their production Canada has
[2689.9s] not completed a single new liquefaction
[2692.6s] facility there's one that's supposed to
[2694.6s] come online soon in um kemat that was
[2697.5s] approved by the Harper government it's
[2699.0s] only now coming online the Germans
[2701.7s] actually built an import terminal in 194
[2705.2s] days from concept to completion um the
[2709.2s] we've had Direct formal requests for our
[2711.4s] natural gas from Japan Greece Germany
[2716.3s] France and I'm probably missing some
[2718.8s] others um we have the fifth biggest
[2721.2s] Supply we have cold weather which makes
[2723.5s] it much cheaper to liquefy gas it takes
[2726.4s] 11 days to ship to Asia from BC takes 20
[2729.6s] days from the US GF Coast so it's
[2731.8s] basically half the shipping time um and
[2735.7s] and and you figured out a way to
[2737.0s] monetize cold weather yes exactly it's a
[2739.8s] very difficult thing to do exactly which
[2742.1s] also will help with with data centers
[2744.7s] data centers which um we're going to
[2747.0s] need data centers for AI and blockchain
[2750.4s] and countless other things uh that we
[2752.8s] have we can we have the energy for it
[2754.4s] takes tremendous amount of energy to to
[2757.6s] power these data centers apparently a a
[2761.3s] chat GPT
[2763.6s] inquiry is 10 times more energy
[2767.2s] intensive than a Google inquiry so I
[2771.2s] think it's I think it's
[2773.8s] 2.9 um Watt hours that is necessary to
[2777.9s] answer one chat GPT question it's
[2781.3s] only3 wat hours to to process a Google
[2785.4s] search so in other words about human
[2787.6s] brains is it turns out the remarkable
[2789.7s] thing about human brains is how smart
[2791.3s] they are for how little energy they use
[2793.9s] right right whereas we're building
[2795.3s] machines that are super intelligent but
[2797.0s] they're very energy hungry right well we
[2799.1s] have a lot of artificial intelligence in
[2800.8s] government as well but it's a different
[2803.6s] kind yeah yeah but we could be powering
[2806.7s] these data centers with Canadian natural
[2809.2s] gas uh um generators with nuclear we
[2813.2s] have the biggest supply of uranium we
[2815.0s] invented the can do we have the
[2818.0s] incredible nuclear physicists and
[2819.9s] Engineers 60% of Ontario's energy
[2822.2s] already comes from nuclear so we could
[2824.4s] be powering these these facilities and
[2826.8s] they're they're just beasts uh go that
[2829.4s] are going to gobble up electricity the
[2831.1s] tech companies are absolutely desperate
[2832.6s] for it right I mean Facebook I
[2834.8s] understand they're they're looking at uh
[2836.3s] building their own nuclear plant to
[2838.9s] power yeah Microsoft revitalized three m
[2841.2s] Island I didn't know that y y y and they
[2844.7s] bought all the power that it's going to
[2845.9s] generate we have about
[2848.4s] 250 uh data centers in
[2851.7s] Canada uh we could do a hell of a lot
[2854.0s] more uh and our this the our secret
[2857.6s] sauce is our energy our incredible
[2859.8s] supply of energy of all kinds Hydro
[2862.2s] nuclear natural gas you name it um so
[2866.0s] let's unleash the production of these
[2868.0s] resources and bring all that money home
[2869.7s] we could try to organize things so that
[2871.5s] energy superpower wasn't a uh an
[2874.8s] insulting phrase well it you know
[2878.4s] National Bank did a study if you want to
[2880.6s] talk to these environmental loons that
[2882.8s] hate our energy
[2884.5s] sector they said uh the great Economist
[2888.0s] uh Stefan Mariana out of out of Calgary
[2890.2s] National Bank said if we displaced half
[2893.2s] of the El the electricity demand that
[2896.0s] India will have added to its grid over
[2899.4s] the next 20 years by supplying our
[2901.8s] natural gas instead of them using coal
[2904.7s] it would reg reduce global emiss ISS by
[2908.0s] 2.5 billion tons which is three times
[2912.0s] the the emissions of all of Canada so in
[2915.8s] other words by exporting our gas which
[2918.6s] is half as emissions intensive as coal
[2923.0s] we could do far more than it would we
[2925.0s] could even do if we shut our entire
[2926.4s] economy down and disappeared from the
[2928.2s] earth so why don't we why don't we
[2930.8s] address the environment with energy
[2933.2s] abundance instead of energy
[2935.7s] poverty well that's obviously the moral
[2937.9s] thing to do with regards to the
[2939.3s] alleviation of absolute poverty as well
[2941.5s] yeah because the the there's an
[2944.3s] environmental case to be made for that
[2945.9s] too which I learned about about 15 years
[2948.9s] ago if you if you alleviate absolute
[2953.8s] poverty the people who are now
[2956.2s] comparatively wealthy so say starting to
[2958.2s] move into the middle class take a much
[2960.4s] longer term view of their lives and
[2963.0s] their children's lives and their
[2964.2s] grandchildren's lives which are now
[2965.6s] relatively assured and they're much more
[2968.0s] likely to take environmental action at
[2969.7s] the local level so it looks like the
[2972.0s] fastest Pathway to a genuinely green and
[2974.8s] sustainable future is through the
[2977.2s] eradication of absolute poverty right
[2979.3s] and the most effective route to that is
[2981.1s] cheap energy right right so absolutely
[2983.6s] so it looks like we could have a green
[2985.5s] future and eat our cake too so to speak
[2987.8s] and Canada could definitely be at the
[2989.6s] Forefront of that absolutely so okay so
[2992.3s] I want to turn back to some numbers the
[2995.3s] deficit this year was 61 billion that
[2998.0s] was last year's deficit sorry last year
[3000.2s] last year and there's 40 million people
[3002.0s] in Canada and so that's
[3004.2s] $1,500 per person Federal
[3007.5s] overspending and that's $66,000
[3010.4s] essentially per family so just for
[3012.4s] everybody watching and listening your
[3014.5s] federal government spent $6,000 of your
[3017.7s] family's money last year going over
[3022.2s] their budget that's just what they spent
[3024.4s] in excess of what they had originally
[3026.3s] budgeted
[3027.4s] right and that's on top of having among
[3029.9s] the highest taxes in the world with our
[3032.1s] you know
[3033.0s] 53% highest marginal tax rate plus
[3035.7s] carbon Tax Plus High payroll taxes plus
[3039.0s] High business taxes plus High uh capital
[3042.5s] gains taxes so they're they're taking in
[3046.3s] more money than ever before they've
[3049.2s] taxed they've squeezed the taxpayer out
[3051.8s] of every last dime and they're still $62
[3055.0s] billion short right and and that's just
[3057.1s] one level of government by the way then
[3058.6s] the provinces have deficits that
[3060.7s] compound the federal one so we have way
[3063.7s] too much government and uh we need to
[3065.6s] reduce the size and cost of government
[3067.6s] and Unleash the Power of the the of of
[3070.7s] the free market okay so it's also the
[3073.2s] case that we haven't gone into
[3075.0s] Diagnostics yet but it's also the case
[3077.0s] that the Trudeau Administration has
[3078.7s] increased the federal bureaucracy
[3082.4s] 40% in bodies yes in bodies since it's
[3085.7s] Inception yeah right but despite that
[3089.2s] they've also radically increased the
[3091.2s] amount of money that they're spending on
[3095.0s] Consultants yes who are about as
[3097.2s] expensive they're as expensive as
[3099.6s] employees they way more expensive yeah
[3101.9s] as any employee you could ever possibly
[3103.7s] have right $600 an hour something like
[3106.7s] that right so they've massively
[3109.1s] increased the size of the federal
[3110.8s] bureaucracy but also massively increase
[3113.5s] the degree to which they Outsource the
[3115.3s] work that hypothetic the bureaucrats
[3117.4s] should be doing and this is not it
[3120.1s] sounds like one of those sort of
[3122.1s] annoying things that uh that bothers us
[3126.4s] all but isn't very substantive you know
[3129.2s] you think these you know one guy is
[3130.6s] making 600 bucks an hour we're spending
[3134.0s] $21
[3135.8s] billion on federal government
[3138.3s] Consultants alone that's
[3141.7s] $1,400 per Canadian family in federal
[3145.8s] taxes just for Consultants right per
[3148.9s] year that's recurring that's not a
[3150.6s] one-time cost so it is an insane amount
[3154.4s] of money to be spending on that
[3156.9s] especially when you have more
[3157.9s] bureaucrats to supposedly do the work
[3161.0s] and arguably they're delivering worse
[3163.4s] results than ever before I mean our
[3164.9s] border is more porous our military has
[3167.7s] been weakened um and our basic Services
[3171.2s] we or
[3172.6s] devastated well you could put it either
[3175.0s] way I mean it's been I I think it's been
[3177.0s] definitely been weakened and despite the
[3178.8s] heroism of the men and women who still
[3180.6s] serve uh the political leadership has
[3183.7s] undermined it in every possible way
[3185.6s] right immigration poorest border I think
[3188.6s] our per capita immigration rate exceeds
[3190.6s] that of the US even given the US Open
[3192.9s] Southern border Oh by far in in we had a
[3197.4s] population growth of 1.2
[3201.3s] million uh in
[3203.5s] 2023 that's on a base of 40 million
[3206.2s] people
[3207.6s] so it's an astonishing number of people
[3210.6s] to bring in in one year everyone now
[3213.1s] admits that this was a Calamity um for
[3216.7s] housing the job market and our
[3219.4s] Healthcare Sy well trudu himself walked
[3221.0s] it back recently he walked it back with
[3223.5s] what was the approximation of a public
[3225.4s] apology yes well this is after he called
[3228.4s] everyone who questioned his immigration
[3230.3s] policy a racist right and then he
[3232.8s] adopted the policies that he cons he was
[3234.8s] calling racist um only a year and a half
[3237.4s] earlier so okay so that's a lot of I
[3241.2s] just talked to Terry gaven Canadian
[3243.6s] journalist this week too and he did a
[3245.9s] about a five-dimensional analysis of the
[3248.6s] trouble that Canada was in it was it was
[3251.0s] blackly comic in some ways because we
[3253.5s] realized at the end of the conversation
[3256.0s] or near the end of it that we hadn't
[3257.5s] even discussed the everpresent threat of
[3260.2s] the Quebec separatists and I was
[3262.1s] thinking oh my God like Canada's in a
[3264.0s] pretty dismal State when the threat of
[3266.7s] Quebec's separatism is number sixth on
[3269.4s] the list of threats to the Integrity of
[3271.7s] the country yes right so okay so now
[3273.8s] this that's making a comeback too God I
[3276.9s] know I me the PQ is now leading in the
[3279.1s] polls in Quebec after they had been
[3280.8s] completely obliterated in the Harper era
[3283.6s] separatism was completely dead in Quebec
[3286.3s] and now it's making a Resurgence and
[3288.2s] ironically of desperation than anything
[3290.2s] else well I mean it's it's interesting
[3291.7s] that the leader of the PQ has actually
[3293.5s] been making economic arguments in favor
[3296.1s] of separate they used to always try to
[3298.0s] avoid that because most quebecers would
[3299.8s] say well clearly we'd be worse off
[3302.1s] economically if we left but because
[3304.7s] Trudeau has been such and and Freeland
[3307.0s] and the entire liberal gang in Ottawa
[3308.8s] has been such a colossal disaster for
[3311.1s] our national economy the separatists are
[3313.6s] now able to make the argument that they
[3317.7s] would be better off separating from that
[3320.0s] Calamity um now I I intend to plan all
[3322.7s] along maybe I intend to reverse that
[3324.8s] argument by making our economy strong
[3326.8s] again but it really is um astonishing to
[3329.4s] see uh how badly things have changed in
[3332.0s] every respect okay so this is really
[3334.7s] transpired in large part over the the 9
[3338.4s] to 10 year period that Trudeau has been
[3340.3s] governing and so when you are trying to
[3343.9s] put your finger on what went so so wrong
[3347.4s] so calamitously wrong what what do you
[3350.6s] think the major contributors were I mean
[3352.8s] there's a lot of hydras whose heads were
[3355.6s] encountering at the moment and I imagine
[3358.0s] it's relatively difficult to trace a
[3360.5s] causal pathway but what did we do wrong
[3363.3s] as a
[3365.1s] country well I mean we we it's it's it
[3368.3s] doesn't what I'm about to say is not uh
[3371.0s] shock to anyone we we have a prime
[3373.7s] minister who is dedicated to a extremely
[3376.6s] radical ideology uh it is just a
[3380.2s] rehashed um socialism that has been
[3383.7s] discredited again and again and again
[3385.7s] throughout the ages and his um basically
[3390.0s] authoritarian socialism is has guided
[3392.7s] him throughout his entire Prime
[3394.9s] ministership he believes in a state that
[3396.9s] controls every aspect of your life your
[3399.5s] money your speech your thought um CL
[3403.4s] controls the economic uh all of the
[3406.2s] industries of the country um and every
[3409.7s] time that has been tried it is a
[3411.2s] complete disaster so it's there's no
[3413.6s] mystery involved it it is the same old
[3417.0s] disastrous outcome that results from the
[3419.0s] same old disastrous policies right that
[3421.0s] that have demonstrated themselves as
[3422.6s] disastrous continuously throughout the
[3424.5s] 20th century exactly okay so so one of
[3427.1s] the things that that I think is
[3429.1s] particularly striking I I saw Steven
[3431.5s] Gilbo who's probably the minister in
[3434.3s] Trudeau's cabinet who's most uh
[3437.3s] fervently um he describes himself social
[3440.2s] economy well this is the thing so he
[3442.4s] described himself as a socialist and so
[3444.7s] for all you International people
[3446.2s] listening Canada has always had a
[3448.4s] socialist party and that's the new
[3450.0s] Democratic party the NDP which is
[3452.2s] currently run by Jag meet Singh who's
[3454.2s] propping up Trudeau all his
[3456.4s] protestations to the contrary and
[3459.2s] Canadians have always been about 20% of
[3463.5s] Canadians have stably supported the
[3466.9s] Socialists the NDP and Canada and that's
[3469.1s] been true since about 1962 or something
[3472.2s] when they first popped up as a as a
[3474.4s] federal party now the Liberals and
[3477.9s] that's Trudeau's party have been a
[3479.8s] Centrist party historically speaking and
[3482.0s] they were the home of the classic
[3484.1s] liberals All Things Considered and they
[3486.6s] like to steal good ideas from the left
[3488.6s] and from the right and and chart
[3491.2s] Canada's course down the middle the
[3493.4s] thing about Trudeau liberals is they're
[3495.4s] not liberals is they're far-left
[3497.7s] socialists and they came to power in the
[3500.2s] guise of liberals and that meant that
[3501.8s] they're
[3502.6s] bloody their their government was
[3504.9s] fraudulent
[3507.0s] technically speaking from the beginning
[3509.3s] because Gilbo for example obviously
[3512.0s] should have been a member of the NDP and
[3514.7s] not the classic traditional Canadian
[3517.1s] liberals but he didn't care because he
[3519.0s] knew that had he run for the Socialists
[3521.6s] he would have ended up with 20% of the
[3523.5s] vote because that's what they always do
[3525.0s] and never had any clear pathway to power
[3527.6s] and so Trudeau brought a bunch of people
[3529.5s] in who were so radically left that they
[3532.4s] left the NDP in the dust essentially and
[3535.6s] they've been running the country on
[3536.9s] false pretenses for 9 years and if you
[3540.2s] Ally that with the fact that Trudeau is
[3542.4s] clearly he he clearly has narcissistic
[3545.3s] personality characteristics and runs the
[3548.1s] country I think as his as a what as a
[3552.2s] testament to his own Grandeur it's
[3554.6s] something like that and one of your
[3556.8s] caucus members recently stood up in the
[3558.8s] house and I think listed something
[3560.4s] approximating 60 scandals I mean I've
[3563.0s] been scandalized by that because my
[3566.3s] observation I've been watching the
[3567.7s] Canadian political landscape for you
[3569.8s] know five decades and the Trudeau
[3572.6s] government has skated through at least a
[3575.9s] half a dozen scandals that under normal
[3578.6s] circumstances would have provoked an
[3581.2s] honorable government to resign and and
[3584.7s] then that doesn't count the other 54 and
[3587.8s] so at the moment Trudeau's grip on
[3592.4s] Authority is very shaky his Deputy Prime
[3595.1s] Minister resigned last week in a cloud
[3598.0s] of catastropic catastrophic surreal uh
[3603.2s] manipulation um he shuffled his cabinet
[3606.1s] this week at least a third of his caucus
[3608.2s] doesn't have any confidence in him but
[3611.1s] he's being propped up by the Socialists
[3614.2s] Jag meet Singh in particular who also
[3618.0s] continually proclaims publicly that he
[3621.9s] is an opponent of the Trudeau government
[3624.5s] and is standing up against him
[3626.6s] well refusing categorically to do
[3630.9s] anything to do the thing that's actually
[3633.2s] in his power to bring down the
[3634.4s] government so do you want to I just
[3636.6s] can't understand this at all so do you
[3638.5s] want to walk us through this well let's
[3640.6s] first of all
[3641.7s] um shed a brief tear for Jag meet Singh
[3645.8s] because the problem he has is that he's
[3649.0s] trying to be an NDP leader we already
[3651.1s] have an NDP prime minister I mean Jus
[3653.7s] trudo is um he's actually much more
[3656.1s] radical than the traditional NDP as the
[3659.2s] NDP themselves admit the previous
[3661.2s] leaders of the NDP yes he he attacked
[3663.6s] the NDP for trudo attacked the NDP for
[3666.0s] being too conservative yeah um but
[3669.0s] because he had the comfortable blanket
[3671.2s] uh of the liberal party which governed
[3673.4s] for most of the last century people
[3675.4s] didn't realize what kind of radical they
[3677.5s] were dealing with
[3680.0s] um the second problem Jag me Singh has
[3682.6s] is that all of his political ideology is
[3684.9s] implemented now so right and we're
[3687.7s] seeing it like people look around and
[3689.2s] say okay this is what it looks like the
[3690.8s] Utopia the NDP has been spinning in the
[3694.3s] corner of parliament uh they told us
[3696.4s] everything was going to be free and
[3697.7s] wonderful and just and there would be um
[3701.2s] racial Equity there there would be uh
[3703.1s] you know there would be unicorns and
[3705.5s] butterflies uh and rainbows and this
[3707.7s] would be the Utopia well now the all of
[3710.2s] their
[3711.7s] policy all of their agenda is
[3713.8s] implemented and people look around and
[3716.2s] it's a hellscape um you know we have,
[3719.1s] 1400 homeless encampments in Ontario 35
[3721.9s] in Halifax we have um hate crimes are up
[3727.7s] 23% in the last nine years um the
[3730.9s] military is decimated wages are dropping
[3733.4s] like it it's the list goes on and so Jag
[3736.2s] me Singh is trying to
[3737.6s] disown that
[3739.7s] ideology even though that it it belongs
[3742.1s] to him uh and he's trying to make some
[3744.6s] trying to unsuccess
[3746.8s] sucessfully to convince people that he's
[3750.2s] come somehow different than that when in
[3753.6s] fact Trudeau has only been doing what
[3756.2s] Singh would have done in his place um
[3759.2s] and so uh it is a classic for socialists
[3762.4s] what they try to do is change their
[3764.2s] names and move on and try to forget have
[3767.4s] everyone forget their past uh and when I
[3771.0s] say that he had socialists changed their
[3773.1s] names I I mean you know they they first
[3775.4s] they were
[3776.6s] Communists and then they became
[3778.2s] socialists and then they became social
[3780.2s] Democrats and then they became they
[3782.2s] stole the world liberal and then they
[3784.6s] they they ruined that word so they
[3786.1s] changed their name to progressives and
[3787.7s] then they changed their name to woke and
[3789.2s] now they claim they don't want to be
[3790.4s] called woke anymore the Socialists
[3792.7s] always try to disown the things they've
[3795.2s] done because it's manifestly disastrous
[3798.0s] and that is what sing is trying to do
[3799.7s] while simultaneously keeping Trudeau's
[3802.0s] government going he voted just a couple
[3804.7s] of weeks ago
[3806.4s] against a non-confidence motion that I
[3808.9s] put forward which contains sing's own
[3811.6s] criticisms of Trudeau in sing's own
[3813.8s] words so he voted against his own words
[3816.4s] to keep Trudeau in power um but I will
[3819.6s] remind how do you how do you account
[3821.4s] from that for that from a motivational
[3824.0s] perspective I mean the scuttlebutt in
[3825.8s] the Canadian press is that Singh Is
[3828.7s] propping up the government for personal
[3830.8s] reasons say regarding his pension now
[3833.1s] you're making a much more political case
[3835.4s] but but I I can't understand how he can
[3838.2s] reconcile himself to himself because
[3840.8s] what he does is so at odds with what he
[3843.5s] says that it couldn't be more different
[3846.0s] like if he if he Allied him the other
[3849.2s] thing I can't figure out maybe you can
[3850.7s] shed some light on this is like when
[3852.9s] Singh agreed to act as Trudeau's support
[3857.6s] why the hell didn't he negotiate a
[3859.3s] cabinet seat I mean why didn't he make
[3861.0s] it into a formal Coalition I know that's
[3863.0s] not a traditional Canadian move but it
[3865.7s] could happen and so he sold his soul to
[3868.8s] Trudeau fundamentally decimated his own
[3871.8s] party and gained nothing in return
[3875.3s] including what he could have gained had
[3877.0s] he bargained properly that's how it
[3878.6s] looks to me and what do you think about
[3880.9s] that I he's not a very good negotiator
[3883.8s] that's for sure yeah yeah and what what
[3886.3s] you're seeing is the all of these
[3888.0s] egomaniacs uh in both the NDP and what
[3891.0s] we now call the Liberal
[3892.7s] Party um are turning on each other
[3895.2s] because they all want to disown their
[3898.2s] Collective record they all of them want
[3900.2s] to say oh I wasn't part of this and
[3902.3s] whether it's uh the fin outgoing Finance
[3904.6s] Minister Freeland or Mark Carney who's
[3906.8s] been writing the financial plan behind
[3908.7s] the scenes uh or Jag me Singh uh they're
[3912.5s] all trying to say I wasn't there I
[3914.7s] wasn't part of it uh I'm something
[3916.8s] completely different than what you see
[3919.3s] uh and uh that is just a an illustration
[3922.8s] of how much of a disaster their agenda
[3924.8s] has been um and I think that's why we're
[3928.3s] doing so well and and we're going to
[3930.5s] defeat them and Canadians will give me a
[3932.8s] mandate to take the country in a
[3934.7s] completely opposite
[3937.8s] direction okay so what do you see on the
[3940.8s] horizon in the upcoming year I I want to
[3944.7s] talk about two things what's what do you
[3946.3s] think is going to unfold well even in
[3948.4s] January I mean once once Parliament
[3951.4s] reconvenes and what you expect from
[3955.1s] Trudeau in terms of his political action
[3957.3s] then what you
[3958.9s] expect as the Liberal Party tries to
[3961.4s] reformulate itself like I I can't
[3963.0s] imagine a scenario not really where
[3965.6s] Trudeau leads liberals into the next
[3967.3s] election that seems to me highly
[3969.2s] improbable it wouldn't surprise me if he
[3971.5s] has to be removed Kicking and Screaming
[3973.4s] so to speak but I'd like to hear your
[3976.0s] thoughts on on what are Canadians to
[3978.4s] expect in the upcoming
[3980.4s] months so parliament's back in late
[3982.9s] January um it will take some weeks to
[3985.1s] actually get a non-confidence vote onto
[3986.9s] the floor of the House of Commons then
[3988.4s] we'll see if Jag meat sing's latest
[3990.6s] promise of voting non-confidence uh was
[3993.2s] as insincere as his prior commitments to
[3995.9s] that effect um when does his pension
[3998.6s] kick in in February so uh he's now
[4001.4s] basically he said
[4003.1s] yesterday that uh he would put forward a
[4006.2s] non-confidence motion at the earliest
[4008.3s] opportunity well that's likely to be
[4009.7s] March which is oh that's convenient okay
[4012.5s] so that problems off so really so so
[4015.6s] March is the earliest as far as you can
[4017.8s] see that that that election could be
[4020.2s] called Singh will not vote
[4022.0s] non-confidence before he gets his
[4024.6s] pension or at least he will not vote
[4027.3s] non-confidence in a way that sees the
[4028.8s] election happen before his pension kicks
[4030.8s] in so um we won't have an election
[4034.4s] before very late winter early spring um
[4038.8s] then there's the possibility that the
[4040.4s] the trudo resigns and then goes to the
[4043.1s] governor general and says we need to
[4044.3s] shut down Parliament while the Liberal
[4046.0s] Party then chooses uh a new replacement
[4050.1s] um a Trudeau 2.0 and so there would be a
[4053.8s] leadership race God knows how long that
[4055.5s] would drag on for during you think
[4057.7s] approximately in March no earlier than
[4059.6s] March as far as you can foresee yeah
[4061.9s] probably and during which time we
[4063.9s] continue to flounder and twist twist in
[4065.7s] the in the wind um and by the way you
[4068.3s] know the liberal media is all saying
[4069.7s] well surely you wouldn't want to trigger
[4071.7s] an election during a liberal leadership
[4074.0s] race um excuse me the Canadian people
[4077.0s] are not obliged 41 million people are
[4079.3s] not obliged to wait around while this
[4081.4s] party sorts out its M like these
[4085.6s] guys could have got rid of Trudeau a
[4087.5s] year and a half ago they knew he was a
[4089.4s] disaster then and now they say well
[4091.5s] we're low in the polls so we have to get
[4093.4s] rid of him now you didn't care when he
[4095.6s] was just depriving single mothers of
[4097.6s] food for their kids or doubling housing
[4100.0s] costs or unleashing crime in in
[4102.5s] neighborhoods across the country but now
[4104.6s] you're really concerned about getting
[4106.1s] rid of him because your poll numbers are
[4107.7s] down you want to keep your job sorry
[4110.1s] that's not a good reason to to paralyze
[4112.5s] the entire country in the face by the
[4114.4s] way of a major negotiation with the
[4117.4s] incoming US president who enters with a
[4120.7s] massive and Powerful mandate and a man
[4123.6s] who has proven that he can spot weakness
[4126.2s] from a mile away so the country should
[4129.7s] not be forced to wait for the liberal
[4132.3s] party uh to to clean up its own mess
[4134.9s] they've had PL plenty of time to do that
[4136.6s] what we need now is certainty and the
[4138.8s] only way that can come is through an
[4140.2s] election so the people can decide M and
[4143.6s] so who do you see as contenders on the
[4146.0s] liberal side I mean Freeland I think is
[4148.5s] going to make a run for it but but
[4151.4s] Carney is do you think he's going to
[4152.8s] throw his hat in the ring now he
[4155.4s] famously uh rejected the opportunity to
[4158.2s] become trudos Finance after accepting it
[4160.9s] after accepting it well so the the the
[4163.6s] the chronology that were led to to
[4165.7s] believe based
[4167.0s] on sources who' have spoken about it to
[4169.9s] the media is that Carney agreed to the
[4172.5s] job Trudeau went to to
[4175.4s] Freeland uh uh days before she was to
[4178.1s] introduce her fall update and said I'm
[4180.3s] going to be firing you to bring in Mark
[4181.9s] Carney and then when that blew up with
[4184.1s] her unexpected premature resignation
[4187.2s] then Carney looked at it and said I
[4189.4s] don't want any part of this and he
[4191.8s] crawled under his desk and uh so he was
[4195.0s] happy to take the job when it looked
[4197.2s] like it was a clear path but then when
[4199.2s] it was a a Messier path he he hid from
[4202.9s] it why why would have he decided to take
[4205.6s] that job to begin with because that's a
[4207.4s] good question well God you can't imagine
[4209.5s] stepping into a more thankless rule I
[4212.2s] mean want associate with these guys well
[4214.2s] Carney already has a reputation it seems
[4216.5s] to me that if he has Prime ministerial
[4218.3s] Ambitions he just wait for the trudo
[4220.4s] Liberals to cataclysmically degenerate
[4223.3s] even further and then step in as the
[4225.4s] savior look he he's going to try and
[4227.5s] distance himself now but here's the
[4230.0s] problem he signed on as Trudeau's
[4232.2s] economic advisor it's an official role
[4234.5s] he holds today now he's going to make
[4236.9s] one of two arguments one he's going to
[4238.8s] say yes in fact I was his economic
[4241.4s] adviser and therefore I am responsible
[4243.8s] for the $62 billion deficit and the
[4246.8s] catastrophic growth the rising cost of
[4249.4s] living or he's going to say I wasn't
[4252.1s] really his advisor I was just full of it
[4255.3s] you know he has to decide is it was he
[4257.5s] lying to everybody when he claimed he
[4259.2s] was Trudeau's adviser or uh was he
[4262.2s] telling the truth and either way he's
[4264.6s] got a major political problem that he is
[4267.1s] now totally Inseparable from the Trudeau
[4271.0s] record um he supports the carbon tax he
[4273.9s] supports the attack on our energy sector
[4275.8s] he told me in a parliamentary committee
[4278.2s] that he opposed Canadian pipelines even
[4280.8s] though his company has invested in
[4283.6s] pipelines in the Middle East and in
[4286.2s] Brazil you know uh he is part of the
[4289.0s] Davos agenda um he's a he's just every
[4292.4s] bit as radical is Trudeau the only
[4295.0s] difference is he's got a nice Banker's
[4297.9s] haircut and suit and he wears navy blue
[4301.0s] socks rather than Polka Dot Socks um but
[4305.0s] beyond the the Aesthetics he shares
[4307.2s] Trudeau's entire ideology and he and he
[4310.1s] represents the status quo okay okay let
[4314.4s] so what do you see let's let's let's do
[4317.8s] this I want to know what you see
[4320.4s] as like Frankly Speaking I don't envy
[4324.2s] you your job and yeah or the People by
[4327.2s] the way in the Trump administration
[4328.8s] because it's it's very glamorous at the
[4332.0s] moment for them but if they're going to
[4334.3s] cut government inefficiency in a serious
[4336.8s] manner they're going to be doing hard
[4339.3s] administrative labor for a very long
[4341.7s] period of time now you're going to take
[4343.8s] the Helm of Canada when there are five
[4347.1s] dimensions of trouble brewing and
[4349.3s] serious more serious trouble on all of
[4351.7s] those Dimensions than I've ever seen
[4353.3s] plague Canada in my entire life as a
[4355.7s] Canadian and it's worse than that
[4358.2s] because I suspect that the true picture
[4360.7s] is a lot more dismal than we know yes
[4363.5s] okay so that's going to be dumped on you
[4365.3s] sometime in the next year and
[4368.4s] so how are you going to deal with that
[4370.6s] like how are you going to deal with the
[4371.7s] fact that the easiest thing to do for
[4373.6s] Canadians and for the remnants of the
[4376.4s] Legacy Media will be to wait until the
[4380.8s] Trudeau government collapses completely
[4383.2s] dumps the economic mess on your
[4384.9s] shoulders and then two months later
[4386.9s] Proclaim that it's it's your fault right
[4389.2s] well and it will be your responsibility
[4390.9s] at that point and so like they they get
[4394.1s] the party I get the hangover oh you
[4396.6s] definitely are going to get the hangover
[4398.0s] there's no doubt about that and that's
[4400.0s] that's a formidable set of problems now
[4403.8s] as we've already pointed out Canada has
[4406.0s] a tremendous number of natural and
[4408.3s] cultural advantages but still like
[4411.2s] there's a lot of now you have a senate
[4413.4s] that's packed with liberal progressives
[4415.6s] let's call it call them by their proper
[4417.3s] name you have a senate that's packed
[4419.1s] with progressives you have a Judiciary
[4421.2s] that's packed with progressives you have
[4423.1s] municipalities all across the country
[4425.0s] that are progressive even once you win
[4427.8s] there's going to be a lot of opposition
[4430.6s] to your movement forward and you're
[4432.9s] going to inherit all these problems so
[4435.2s] so like are you trying to are you trying
[4438.2s] to dis dissuade me from taking this man
[4442.0s] and so and so I mean I want to know what
[4445.6s] like why you think you're why you think
[4448.2s] you're ready why you and it's been two
[4449.9s] and a half years since we've had this
[4451.3s] convers conversation like this like and
[4454.7s] and what's your what's your plan and who
[4457.2s] are your who are the people you have in
[4459.2s] positions to implement your plan and why
[4461.7s] do you have why should Canadians have
[4464.2s] confidence in them
[4466.4s] so my plan is pretty clear we're going
[4468.9s] to we're going to cut bureaucracy cut
[4470.8s] the Consultants cut foreign aid cut back
[4473.7s] on corporate welfare uh to to large
[4477.1s] corporations we're going to use the
[4478.5s] savings to bring down the deficit and
[4481.2s] taxes unleash the free enterprise system
[4483.6s] we're going to repeal c69 That's the
[4485.9s] anti-energy Law uh to uh uh cause a
[4490.4s] massive resource boom in our country and
[4493.1s] make it attractive for business business
[4495.4s] to do the value added work here in this
[4497.9s] country so we're going to part of it
[4499.7s] going to be growing out of this mess you
[4501.9s] know if you take a national the debt to
[4504.5s] GDP ratio um you have uh the denominator
[4508.2s] has to
[4509.1s] grow and uh that's why we need a bigger
[4512.1s] more powerful GDP that can fund our
[4516.0s] country and diminish the relative size
[4519.0s] of our debts um we're going to bring
[4522.0s] back uh a Monet discipline to bring down
[4526.4s] inflation stop the money printing uh and
[4529.6s] we're going to incentivize the
[4531.4s] municipalities to get building but it's
[4533.5s] going to be a big fight with all of
[4535.2s] these things because there are so many
[4536.7s] vested interests that will be trying to
[4538.6s] hold us back so many small economic
[4542.8s] groups that
[4544.7s] have profited off the status quo they
[4547.4s] will be fighting against me and I'm
[4549.6s] going to have to make put it a call to
[4551.6s] Canadians that they have to stay
[4553.1s] politically active can't assume that
[4557.0s] simply by
[4558.4s] changing uh by voting in an election
[4560.9s] that everything is going to all the
[4563.2s] problems are going to reverse
[4564.7s] instantaneously uh like I will need
[4566.7s] people to put pressure on the Senate to
[4569.0s] adopt my economic reforms uh I will need
[4572.1s] people to put pressure on their Mayors
[4574.1s] and local counselors to get out of the
[4576.6s] way and let us build homes uh I will
[4579.1s] need businesses to actually do their
[4581.2s] part I mean our corporate candada is so
[4583.4s] completely incompetent when it comes to
[4586.1s] politics um they're going to have to
[4588.0s] start to fight for the policies that are
[4590.4s] good for their workers um more
[4592.5s] aggressively and I've said that to them
[4594.0s] they need to fire their incompetent
[4595.7s] lobbyists and actually go to the people
[4598.0s] and make the arguments for the reforms
[4601.4s] that I'm talking about um and only are
[4605.2s] the businesses that you're talking to
[4606.9s] these are larger businesses I presume
[4608.7s] are they do they understand your
[4610.4s] concerns are they on board with your
[4612.3s] they're starting to understand because
[4614.0s] they know that what they have been doing
[4615.7s] hasn't worked um well the energy
[4618.3s] companies have been Towing the green
[4619.7s] line which seems to me to be a very bad
[4621.9s] strategy they're idiots they're complete
[4623.7s] idiots uh the the the big
[4626.7s] five oil companies in Canada have idiot
[4630.9s] lobbyists um they have brilliant workers
[4633.4s] incredible workers but idiot lobbyists
[4636.3s] and they've been trying to suck up for
[4638.2s] the last 10 years and did nothing to
[4641.0s] support the right policies in the prior
[4643.2s] years so that's going to happen to
[4645.1s] change the developers are going to have
[4646.8s] to inform people in the cities why
[4650.6s] housing costs so much you know how is it
[4653.1s] possible that Olivia Chow can raise
[4654.9s] development charges by 30% and nobody in
[4658.0s] Toronto knows about it well it's because
[4660.3s] the builders have not made it known and
[4662.6s] so the builders take the blame when the
[4664.1s] housing costs go up I sorry you have to
[4666.5s] actually politics is a participation
[4669.1s] sport not a spectator sport so our
[4672.1s] business Community is going to have to
[4673.6s] step up and make the argument for these
[4676.1s] changes uh or or or I will come up
[4679.7s] against a lot of political barriers so I
[4684.2s] my message to everyone is God willing I
[4686.9s] I will Triumph in the the election but
[4690.0s] the people who want the changes that I'm
[4692.2s] talking about are going to have to stay
[4693.8s] politically active to push them through
[4696.5s] and over the finish line so one of the
[4698.8s] remarkable things that transpired on the
[4701.5s] American front and rather precipitously
[4703.9s] in the last three months of the election
[4705.9s] was that a remarkable team of people
[4709.2s] aggregated themselves around Trump and
[4712.1s] that well that was heartening because
[4714.7s] each of those people had their own um
[4718.0s] track record of Stellar accomplishment
[4721.0s] but it also helped decrease people's
[4723.0s] concern about Trump as a individualistic
[4726.4s] autocrat let's say um now you're very
[4730.5s] well known in Canada I would say and and
[4733.3s] and increasingly International
[4735.6s] I'd say that's less true of your team
[4738.4s] and so could you tell us like can you
[4741.0s] point to some people who will be key in
[4742.8s] your Administration and highlight their
[4745.4s] I'd like to know what you think their
[4747.1s] strengths are so let's walk through your
[4749.4s] your the core elements of your team and
[4751.7s] also I'd like to hear a little bit about
[4753.5s] where you think you guys still need to
[4755.4s] learn and might need further development
[4758.4s] well listen I uh I'll go through some of
[4760.7s] the names uh we for example we've got uh
[4764.8s] Andrew Shear who was the party leader a
[4767.8s] few years ago but he he he actually did
[4770.2s] a good job as party leader uh and
[4773.0s] learned a lot in that process he was the
[4775.6s] speaker of the house and that's
[4777.3s] important in a house leader he he knows
[4779.8s] the rules of the game because a lot of
[4782.0s] the stuff that gets done or doesn't get
[4784.6s] done is the result of
[4786.2s] procedural Maneuvers so you need someone
[4788.9s] who understands procedure and he
[4791.0s] understands it better than anyone that's
[4792.5s] why I think our house strategy has been
[4795.2s] so successful um one of my former
[4798.9s] leadership Rivals uh Dr leson Lewis is
[4801.8s] uh our shadow minister of uh
[4804.8s] infrastructure and she's doing a great
[4806.9s] job in talking about how we can rebuild
[4809.5s] the infrastructure of the country um I
[4812.6s] think um you know we've got uh new
[4815.4s] newcomers like um Jal javani uh who was
[4819.0s] recently elected in an overwhelming
[4820.9s] mandate in uh Durham um and and um
[4825.8s] Melissa lansman our Deputy leader
[4827.8s] extremely well-liked in Toronto a very
[4830.4s] wellknown across the country she's been
[4833.0s] a terrific Communicator very smart so
[4836.5s] these are very good people and we're of
[4838.1s] course recruiting a whole Army of
[4840.3s] candidates who are not yet elected in
[4842.3s] our non- held writings that will help me
[4845.4s] uh not just win the election but govern
[4848.1s] if God willing we do who do you have on
[4850.2s] the energy side
[4852.4s] federally well we're kind of Lu Lucky in
[4855.0s] that respect that we have uh a huge
[4858.3s] Western caucus right we we dominate in
[4861.0s] Alberta and Saskatchewan so you know
[4863.8s] there's very few MPS in our Prairie
[4866.6s] caucus that don't understand energy
[4869.3s] because they all grew up with it as you
[4870.9s] recall from your your time is in
[4872.9s] Alberton and uh they know what to do and
[4875.6s] I've also planned to uh I've talked to
[4877.9s] Daniel Smith and I said look um and and
[4882.1s] Scott Mo who's the premier of
[4883.7s] Saskatchewan I said look you you guys
[4885.5s] need to be ready uh for when I win uh we
[4890.3s] need your help to reform the approval
[4894.2s] laws so that we can get some resource
[4896.5s] projects going like immediately um and
[4900.2s] uh you know I won't speak for her but
[4903.2s] Premier Smith from Alberta who's a
[4905.3s] fantastic leader has said she she's
[4907.4s] happy to help and she knows the energy
[4910.0s] sector inside out and backwards and I'm
[4912.9s] talking to for example Greg rickord from
[4915.1s] Northern Ontario he's the guy who's been
[4917.6s] champing the ring of fire which is all
[4920.2s] just a massive uh collection of minerals
[4923.1s] in Northern Ontario that we we've been
[4925.1s] talking about mining for the last 15
[4927.2s] years and hasn't been able to get
[4928.8s] approved he's the one who's got the plan
[4930.8s] to approve that so I've been talking
[4932.7s] with him a lot um and uh you'll see more
[4936.5s] names come forward as the as we get
[4938.3s] closer to the election okay okay so so
[4942.2s] your your fundamental plan is to
[4945.2s] eliminate obstacles let's say
[4947.6s] bureaucratic obstacles procedur
[4949.6s] obstacles and to facilitate growth out
[4953.6s] of Canada's current Mala yes and you see
[4957.4s] that a lot of what you've talked about
[4959.6s] today is on the resource front and so
[4962.5s] and you have Premier who are going to
[4965.0s] back that um Canada is also a
[4968.3s] sophisticated Nation there's we're we're
[4970.8s] more than hewers of wood let's say and
[4972.6s] drawers of water and purvey of energy um
[4976.8s] why don't you talk a little bit about
[4979.1s] let's presume for the sake of argument
[4981.8s] that you have two terms 8 years yeah
[4984.3s] let's say and which is not
[4986.6s] an I think that that's a reasonable
[4989.7s] prognostication if things go at least
[4992.7s] moderately well right and so eight years
[4996.8s] from now what is the Canada that you are
[5001.0s] planning to lead what does it look like
[5003.4s] I think it's a country
[5005.1s] where any young person can say this is
[5007.9s] the place to start a business this is
[5009.9s] the per place to take a risk and break
[5012.5s] through it's a country where um a
[5016.1s] country of adventurers explorers
[5018.6s] inventors workers people who are
[5021.4s] extremely ambitious and rewarded for
[5024.2s] that ambition um it's a place where not
[5027.1s] only do we graduate brilliant engineers
[5029.6s] in Kitchener waterl where we do some of
[5032.8s] the best in the world yes but but they
[5035.4s] say hell no I'm not leaving Canada this
[5038.2s] is the place to be this is where uh the
[5041.2s] best tech company is hiring the next 700
[5044.9s] people this is where I can get the best
[5046.9s] salary and this is where I can keep most
[5048.9s] of my paycheck oh and by the way it's
[5050.8s] now affordable for me to buy a home here
[5053.3s] in Canada um it's a place where so
[5056.6s] that's the best rejoinder to the
[5058.1s] Americans I would say fundamentally you
[5060.6s] know for Canadians who are concerned
[5062.2s] about undue American influence on Canada
[5065.6s] the best possible rejoiner would be to
[5067.5s] make Canada a place so welcome to
[5070.1s] entrepreneur entrepreneurs that the US
[5072.5s] would pale in comparison that's a tall
[5074.7s] order because the Americans are deeply
[5077.0s] entrepreneurial and have a very
[5079.0s] business-friendly Society right like yes
[5082.0s] at every level right they reward
[5084.0s] entrepreneurial activity okay so and so
[5086.1s] I I want to see that we we you know for
[5088.0s] the first 14 years of this Century
[5090.3s] Canada had more American
[5092.7s] Investment than America had Canadian
[5095.1s] investment in other words we were
[5096.4s] winning the TG of- war of capitalism
[5098.1s] with the greatest capitalist economy the
[5099.8s] world has ever seen um and then in from
[5103.9s] 2015 to present we've there's been a net
[5106.2s] outflow of a half a trillion dollars
[5108.5s] measured in USD from Canada to the US
[5111.0s] it's astonishing when in the last 10
[5113.3s] years half a trillion half a trillion
[5115.5s] which is and that's in American dollars
[5117.0s] that's 700ish billion in
[5120.0s] Canadian uh which is the equivalent of
[5122.6s] about a quarter of our economy has just
[5124.7s] left it's Canadian investment I mean the
[5126.6s] government admits that the Pension funds
[5128.6s] are now investing in the states Canadian
[5131.2s] Pension funds Canadian rsps they're all
[5134.2s] invested because that's where you get
[5135.3s] the best return right now I want to
[5137.3s] bring that back right so that's like
[5138.8s] $40,000 per Canadian something like that
[5141.3s] that's right so why we bring that
[5143.0s] $20,000 per Canadian 80,000 per family
[5145.9s] but let's bring it back uhuh let's bring
[5147.5s] it back let's make this the best place
[5149.1s] to get a return on your investment let's
[5151.4s] make this the best place in the world to
[5152.7s] do business to bring hundreds of
[5155.4s] billions of dollarss of investment to be
[5158.2s] dig mines build pipelines business
[5161.2s] centers um new tech companies drill uh
[5165.4s] high-tech Enterprises that you not only
[5167.6s] invent here but you actually keep here
[5169.9s] because it's not just a great place to
[5171.6s] lose money but a great place to make
[5173.5s] money um that I that is the bright
[5177.3s] optimistic future I see I'm looking at
[5180.3s] models for this you look at Ireland
[5182.9s] Ireland my grandfather came from Ireland
[5186.1s] uh you know what a half a century ago
[5187.7s] because Ireland was too poor well now
[5189.8s] Ireland's per capita GDP is twice Canada
[5192.8s] they're they're now
[5194.3s] $100,000 per capita GDP in Canada it's
[5197.4s] 50,000 so what did the Irish do they cut
[5200.0s] taxes they shrunk government government
[5202.6s] is only 23% of the economy 40% here
[5205.9s] right and so they made it Tech friendly
[5208.0s] made it very Tech friendly so like 70%
[5210.2s] of the American 75% of the of the Irish
[5213.6s] economy excuse me is free enterprise um
[5217.7s] and that's why they're just cooking with
[5220.2s] gas look at Singapore
[5222.4s] Switzerland um there are countless uh
[5225.6s] Israel after the 90s becoming startup
[5228.9s] Nation uh the recipe book is already
[5232.4s] written we know what to do unleash free
[5234.5s] enterprise remove the constraints cut
[5237.6s] taxes and allow people to prosper yeah
[5241.3s] well I've heard great things about the
[5243.2s] uh the graduates from the University of
[5245.5s] water people in in in uh the people I
[5248.2s] know in Silicon valy yeah yeah they're
[5250.6s] our biggest export right now yeah well
[5252.4s] they feel that they're the equivalent at
[5254.0s] least of the graduates of the Indian
[5255.8s] Institute of Technology and I mean the
[5257.7s] Indians have had a massive influence in
[5259.4s] Silicon Valley and so Canadians well
[5263.0s] that's that's only one place where
[5265.1s] Canadians are not making nearly the use
[5267.6s] of their resources that they could
[5270.1s] that's on the on the human resource
[5271.7s] front with regard to Engineers well you
[5273.8s] think graduate from waterl and you you
[5276.0s] can pay 53% tax in Canada or 18 or 19 in
[5280.9s] Texas you can pay uh $1.5 million for an
[5286.0s] average house in Canada or you can buy a
[5288.8s] castle for $400,000 in the States you
[5291.1s] can make Canadian dollars which is 69 C
[5294.5s] uh equivalent of the US dollar or you
[5296.2s] can make an American dollar it's
[5298.5s] unfortunately uh there's the pull is
[5300.8s] very hard but we're why don't we get us
[5302.5s] pulling in the other direction why don't
[5304.2s] we make this the most attractive place
[5305.7s] for these
[5307.2s] Brilliant Minds to come out of these
[5310.3s] schools and and build it here and keep
[5312.4s] it here and I think we can do that okay
[5314.9s] so what are you going to do when you
[5316.1s] take a office like how what what does
[5319.1s] that look like practically so what could
[5321.7s] Canadians what could Canadians watch you
[5325.4s] do in the first months of your
[5328.6s] Administration that would help reassure
[5330.6s] them that this is going to happen this
[5331.9s] is real well first of all I'm going to
[5333.0s] ask the carbon tax it's been kind of an
[5335.8s] epic commitment that I've made it's
[5338.0s] iconic and so I have to follow through
[5340.2s] on it
[5341.3s] immediately and that will signal to the
[5343.4s] country that I'm serious second we want
[5345.4s] to get rid of the GST on new
[5347.7s] homes uh and
[5351.2s] make past changes that incen
[5353.9s] aggressively incentivize municipalities
[5356.2s] to get the building started that has to
[5358.4s] happen immediately for people to notice
[5361.4s] any difference in the the cost of
[5363.4s] housing by the time I get through my
[5365.8s] fourth year um we will have rapid
[5370.2s] introduction of the biggest Crackdown on
[5372.4s] crime in Canadian history uh a massive
[5375.7s] Crackdown and what do that look like
[5377.5s] crack down on on on crime basically
[5379.4s] habitual offenders will not get out of
[5381.4s] jail anymore right right 1% of the
[5384.3s] criminals commit 65% of the crimes is
[5388.0s] that right I didn't know that yes well
[5390.0s] they criminals specialize just like
[5391.8s] everyone else right and and the best
[5393.7s] predict of offense in the future is
[5395.9s] repeat offense in the past right right
[5398.0s] so in Vancouver they had to arrest the
[5400.0s] same 40 offenders 6,000 times one year
[5404.0s] yeah well that's exactly a consequence
[5405.7s] of that specialization right when we did
[5408.0s] this last time in the Harper government
[5410.9s] uh we actually reduced crime by 25% but
[5414.3s] interesting this is a very big surprise
[5417.1s] incarcerations went down because the
[5421.3s] people that we kept in prison were in
[5423.4s] and out anyway way it was like the hotel
[5425.1s] California they were checking out but
[5427.0s] they were never really leaving so we had
[5428.6s] to basically save them a bed but
[5431.2s] secondly the smalltime offenders were
[5433.2s] actually deterred you know all of the
[5435.5s] so-called experts say deterrents don't
[5437.2s] work no they do work yeah the best
[5439.3s] deterrent turns out to be probability of
[5441.6s] conviction rather than length of
[5443.3s] sentence and right now though
[5446.4s] it's it's worse than
[5448.7s] that even if you have a probability of
[5451.2s] conviction there's a certainty that
[5452.7s] there won't be any real penalty right
[5454.5s] right that's not a real conviction
[5456.6s] that's not a real conviction so there's
[5458.4s] going to be a very serious Crackdown on
[5460.8s] crime U immigration what's what's the
[5463.0s] scoop there oh we have to slow down the
[5464.6s] numbers there's no doubt about it uh we
[5466.5s] have to end the fraud in the
[5467.7s] international student and the temporary
[5469.2s] foreign worker program um we have to
[5473.4s] well Canada historically had a very
[5475.1s] effective immigration policy best we
[5477.0s] just have to get back to the best system
[5478.4s] in the world which we had for 150 years
[5481.9s] um even in the United States both
[5484.4s] Democrats and Republicans used to say
[5487.6s] they get up at a microphone claim they
[5489.0s] were going to replicate our system
[5490.6s] because it was an undeniable success
[5493.2s] immigration was not even controversial
[5495.6s] before Justin Trudeau because it was so
[5497.8s] well-managed here for so long and and we
[5501.0s] just need to get back to clearly viewed
[5502.6s] as a net benefit by the immigrants and
[5504.6s] by Canadians absolutely and in fact the
[5506.9s] support for immigration was strongest in
[5509.8s] kind of the rural resource and
[5511.8s] agricultural communities where the was
[5514.4s] most needed and welcomed and uh people
[5517.2s] integrated they arrived here and while
[5519.4s] they were we said to people look bring
[5522.0s] your traditions and culture and your
[5525.4s] stories but leave the problems at the
[5528.1s] door and so and this is by the way a
[5530.6s] history for Canada that goes back
[5532.2s] hundreds of years I mean the the
[5533.8s] Protestants and Catholics were ripping
[5536.2s] each other's eyeballs out in Europe for
[5540.1s] centuries um and then they came to
[5542.0s] Canada and they got along they
[5544.8s] ultimately ended up intermarrying and
[5546.6s] integrating completely and um you know
[5549.4s] whether you were an orangeman or a uh or
[5553.7s] a cathol Irish Catholic you you over
[5555.8s] time you got along with your neighbor
[5558.6s] and uh you know in the last nine years
[5561.3s] we've seen that's come apart the foreign
[5564.0s] foreign conflicts are now spilling onto
[5566.2s] our streets I want to put an end to that
[5567.5s] I want to say look we're not interested
[5570.3s] in the
[5571.8s] world's uh ethno cultural conflicts
[5575.8s] we're well we welcome Shadow side of
[5578.4s] multiculturalism we welcome the people
[5580.4s] who come from places that have been
[5582.0s] afflicted by War as long as they leave
[5585.1s] the war behind and frankly that was most
[5588.5s] people come here to get away from those
[5590.7s] things so um by getting back to a common
[5593.7s] sense of values and identity and
[5596.5s] reminding people that they are when they
[5598.0s] get here they are Canadian first Canada
[5601.0s] first um leave the hyphens we don't need
[5603.9s] to be hyphenated Society we need right
[5605.7s] so we can abandon the postnationalist
[5607.8s] state rhetoric and presume that Canada
[5610.2s] does have a western identity founded on
[5614.2s] the a prior principles of Western
[5616.8s] democracies and that that is a uniting
[5619.0s] ethos for the come here and that we we
[5622.3s] owe a debt of gratitude to
[5624.5s] the Giants who came before us who fought
[5627.2s] in Wars who laid down a parliamentary
[5630.2s] democracy uh and who left us behind the
[5634.4s] inredible inheritance yeah I mean we're
[5636.6s] going to be grateful again and we're
[5638.1s] going to inculcate the values of
[5640.1s] gratitude for our incredible history uh
[5643.7s] build up the country um celebrate what
[5646.3s] we have in common rather than dividing
[5648.3s] what what obsessing about what divides
[5650.9s] us um focusing on the shared values that
[5656.8s] make us all Canadian um and I think in
[5661.3s] in so doing we can and by the way put
[5663.4s] aside
[5664.3s] race this obsession with
[5666.2s] race that wokeism has
[5670.0s] reinserted well invented even invented
[5672.8s] in many ways when I moved to Toronto it
[5675.7s] was as race blind as any country as any
[5678.5s] City could be right right and that's
[5681.2s] flipped and it's flipped because of that
[5683.8s] obsessive concern with race right that
[5686.2s] was something we 100% did not need in
[5689.0s] Canada right it's we we basically what
[5692.3s] would you say import Ed and invented
[5695.0s] racism in Canada right well as a
[5698.0s] consequence of policy wokeism seeks to
[5701.7s] divide people into these different
[5704.0s] groups and subgroups and we see the
[5706.5s] results in a 250% increase in hate
[5709.7s] crimes but we're going to get back to
[5711.9s] the basic principle that people are
[5713.8s] judged based on their individual
[5717.0s] character and and Humanity rather than
[5720.5s] by their group identity and that is
[5724.4s] actually ironically the most unifying
[5726.7s] thing we can do to bring our country
[5728.9s] back together and and as uh Lincoln put
[5732.7s] it to bind up the nation's
[5734.7s] wounds all right so we started the
[5737.4s] conversation with a description of the
[5739.4s] manner in which the intergenerational
[5743.0s] compact that makes up the nation had
[5745.4s] started to become violated or Fray right
[5747.8s] you said that young people in particular
[5751.1s] you talked about middle-aged people and
[5752.8s] business people as well well but you
[5754.0s] said young people felt
[5755.8s] that even if they did act responsibility
[5759.7s] responsibly and even if they did
[5761.8s] undertake uh the adventure of their life
[5764.5s] the entrepreneurial adventure of their
[5766.3s] life that the probability that they
[5768.1s] would be successful even in the Centrist
[5772.2s] middle class manner that Canadians had
[5774.4s] become accustomed to that had become
[5776.6s] what had an unlikely that had become an
[5779.5s] unlikely outcome and so your vision it
[5782.5s] sounds to me is to at minimum restore
[5786.0s] that social contract so that young
[5788.3s] people who are interested in adopting
[5791.8s] responsibility and taking some risk can
[5794.2s] be assured that that will meet with
[5797.3s] success and you think that you have the
[5800.0s] team that's in place that can make that
[5804.4s] possible yeah so what have you let's
[5807.3s] close with
[5808.6s] this how are you a different person than
[5811.0s] you were 2 and a half years ago me
[5815.0s] um I would say I'm tougher what does
[5817.6s] that mean tough it's like you watch a
[5819.6s] boxing match and you see these guys get
[5821.4s] hit again and again and again you say
[5822.9s] how is it that you can take a punch the
[5824.3s] average person takes a punch like that
[5825.8s] on the street they'd collapse well once
[5827.8s] you've taken a punch you know how to
[5829.8s] take a punch and uh when you run for
[5832.5s] leader of a the oldest and biggest
[5834.6s] political party in the country and
[5836.0s] you're trying to uh change challenge the
[5840.0s] vested interests uh then you're going to
[5843.0s] take a lot of punches and I have and
[5845.2s] I've withstood those punches and as a
[5847.4s] result I feel stronger now than I did
[5850.1s] when I started I don't feel I have
[5852.8s] beaten down I feel emboldened and
[5855.4s] strengthened from that uh running
[5857.6s] through that Gauntlet right right so
[5860.4s] that hasn't demoralized not at all no in
[5862.5s] fact to the contrary I feel more
[5865.0s] invigorated than ever before
[5867.5s] why because I think uh because I have a
[5871.4s] mission there you know I um it was was
[5875.3s] it Frankle that said he who has a why
[5878.8s] can withstand any what anyhow anyhow
[5881.2s] anyhow yeah um and I have a why I know
[5884.8s] why I'm doing this and uh I want to get
[5888.0s] this done for the country and I want to
[5891.4s] leave behind the opportunity for every
[5894.6s] other Canadian the chance I had as a kid
[5897.9s] and um I know I it's personal for me you
[5901.7s] know I don't come from
[5903.9s] uh a
[5906.0s] privileged or wealthy background I was
[5909.5s] adopted uh by school teachers grew up in
[5911.9s] a normal Suburban neighborhood we didn't
[5914.0s] always have money um but I was able to
[5916.6s] get here MH and my wife's the same story
[5919.8s] you know she came here with nothing and
[5921.4s] she's had a great life her family's had
[5922.9s] a great life I love that about this
[5924.4s] country and the F the idea that I could
[5928.2s] restore that as my life's work for other
[5932.0s] people to me that is uh exhilarating
[5936.1s] that excites me if that could be my the
[5938.2s] only thing I do with
[5940.3s] my career that would be an incredible
[5944.8s] incredibly rewarding
[5946.4s] outcome right right all right well thank
[5948.9s] you sir um it's very good to talk to you
[5951.2s] hopefully it won't be two and a half
[5952.4s] years before we speak again no we should
[5954.0s] do it more often yeah well it's a very
[5955.9s] good forum for apprising people of of
[5958.4s] your plans and your progress and so and
[5960.5s] uh also I on behalf of all Canadians
[5962.4s] want to thank you for your immense
[5964.0s] courage and the personal political price
[5965.9s] that you personal political and
[5967.7s] non-political price that you have paid
[5969.6s] for standing up for your convictions and
[5972.0s] defending freedom of speech because I
[5974.0s] know you have paid a very big price for
[5976.2s] that but you have never bent you have
[5978.4s] never backed down you had a spine of
[5980.5s] Steel and there are countless other
[5982.8s] people who will have the freedom to
[5985.1s] express themselves because you paid the
[5986.9s] price for them so thank you oh thank you
[5988.7s] sir it's been a it's been a privilege
[5990.7s] far more than a price definitely and it
[5992.6s] continues to be that way all right so
[5994.8s] for everybody watching and listening I'm
[5996.9s] going to talk to Mr PV for another half
[5999.4s] an hour on the daily wire side as you
[6000.9s] know and I think probably what we'll do
[6002.8s] there is drill down a little bit on
[6006.3s] Canada US relations um the DW audience
[6010.1s] is very American oriented and so that
[6012.8s] seems to be perfectly appropriate and
[6014.3s] it's something that we didn't cover in
[6015.5s] any great detail in this on this side of
[6018.3s] the conversation and seems particularly
[6020.5s] appr propo given that Trump has been
[6022.5s] making jokes about uh Trudeau being the
[6024.9s] governor of the 51st state and has also
[6027.6s] threatened to put 25% tariffs on Canada
[6030.6s] which I think is more of a ploy than a
[6032.4s] genuine threat but it's definitely
[6034.0s] something that needs to be discussed and
[6036.0s] so we'll talk about the uh trials for
[6039.5s] Canada of having the Americans as their
[6042.2s] southern neighbor but also the immense
[6044.5s] opportunities that go along with that so
[6047.7s] um well we occupy the same continent so
[6050.5s] it' probably be best if we got along you
[6053.0s] know uh uh swimmingly so that's what
[6056.2s] we'll discuss on The Daily wi side so be
[6059.0s] uh be more than welcome to join us
[6061.4s] there thank you again sir thank you
[6065.6s] [Music]
