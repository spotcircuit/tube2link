TLDR: I spent six years building automated businesses with Make.com (most notably 1SecondCopy, a content company that hit 7 figures). Today a lot of people talk about automation, but I’ve noticed that very few have practical, real world success making money with it. So this channel is me chiming in and showing you what *real* systems that make *real* revenue look like.\n\nHopefully I can help you improve your business, and in doing so, the rest of your life 🙏\n\nLike, subscribe, and leave me a comment if you have a specific request!
