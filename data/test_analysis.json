    "description": "Join Maker School & get your first automation customer ‚§µÔ∏è\nhttps://www.skool.com/makerschool/about\n\nSummary ‚§µÔ∏è\nHere are some foundational principles behind how to build better automations. These work across platforms, across use cases, and across programming languages, and I consider them core to how I do things.\n\nMy software, tools, & deals (some give me kickbacks‚Äîthank you!)\nüöÄ Instantly: https://link.nicksaraev.com/instantly-short\nüìß Anymailfinder: https://link.nicksaraev.com/amf-short\nü§ñ Apify: https://console.apify.com/sign-up (30% off with code 30NICKSARAEV)\nüßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª n8n: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/h372ujv8cw80\nüìà Rize: https://link.nicksaraev.com/rize-short (25% off with promo code NICK)\n\nFollow me on other platforms üòà\nüì∏ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/nick_saraev\nüïäÔ∏è Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/nicksaraev\nü§ô Blog: https://nicksaraev.com\n\nWhy watch?\nIf this is your first view‚Äîhi, I‚Äôm Nick! TLDR: I spent six years building automated businesses with Make.com (most notably 1SecondCopy, a content company that hit 7 figures). Today a lot of people talk about automation, but I‚Äôve noticed that very few have practical, real world success making money with it. So this channel is me chiming in and showing you what *real* systems that make *real* revenue look like.\n\nHopefully I can help you improve your business, and in doing so, the rest of your life üôè\n\nLike, subscribe, and leave me a comment if you have a specific request!
